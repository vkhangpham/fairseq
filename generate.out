S-0	Editor's note: In our Behind the <unk-6> series, CNN <unk-9> share their experiences in covering news and <unk-17> the stories behind the events. Here, <unk-24> O'Brien takes users inside a jail where many of the inmates are mentally ill. An inmate housed on the <unk-44> <unk-45> where many mentally ill inmates are housed in Miami before trial. <unk-57> Florida (CNN) -- The ninth floor of the <unk-66> <unk-67> detention facility is dubbed the <unk-44> <unk-74> Here, inmates with the most severe mental illnesses are <unk-84> until they're ready to appear in court. Most often, they face drug charges or charges of assaulting an officer <unk-104> that Judge Steven <unk-108> says are usually <unk-112> <unk-113> He says the arrests often result from <unk-121> with police. <unk-124> ill people often won't do what they're told when police arrive on the scene -- confrontation seems to <unk-143> their illness and they become more <unk-150> <unk-151> and less likely to follow <unk-157> according to <unk-160> So, they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally <unk-171> but not getting any real help because they're in jail. We toured the jail with <unk-160> He is well known in Miami as an advocate for justice and the mentally ill. Even though we were not exactly welcomed with open arms by the <unk-215> we were given permission to shoot <unk-222> and tour the floor. Go inside the <unk-230> <unk-231> » . At first, it's hard to determine where the people are. The prisoners are wearing <unk-248> <unk-249> Imagine cutting holes for arms and feet in a heavy wool sleeping bag -- that's kind of what they look like. They're designed to keep the mentally ill patients from injuring themselves. That's also why they have no shoes, <unk-289> or <unk-291> <unk-108> says about one-third of all people in <unk-66> county <unk-302> are mentally ill. So, he says, the sheer volume is overwhelming the system, and the result is what we see on the ninth floor. Of course, it is a jail, so it's not supposed to be warm and <unk-341> but the lights <unk-345> the cells are tiny and it's <unk-352> We see two, sometimes three men -- sometimes in the <unk-363> sometimes <unk-365> lying or sitting in their cells. "I am the son of the president. You need to get me out of <unk-386> one man shouts at me. He is absolutely serious, convinced that help is on the way -- if only he could reach the White House. <unk-108> tells me that these <unk-417> will often <unk-420> through the system, occasionally <unk-425> in a mental hospital, only to return to jail to face their charges. It's brutally <unk-441> in his mind, and he has become a strong advocate for changing things in Miami. Over a meal later, we talk about how things got this way for mental patients. <unk-108> says 200 years ago people were considered <unk-480> and they were locked up in <unk-302> even if they had no charges against them. They were just considered unfit to be in society. Over the years, he says, there was some public <unk-514> and the mentally ill were moved out of <unk-302> and into hospitals. But <unk-108> says many of these mental hospitals were so horrible they were shut down. Where did the patients <unk-546> <unk-547> The streets. They <unk-551> in many cases, the <unk-556> he says. They never got treatment. <unk-108> says in <unk-566> there were more than half a million people in state mental hospitals, and today that number has been reduced 90 percent, and 40,000 to 50,000 people are in mental hospitals. The judge says he's working to change this. Starting in 2008, many inmates who would otherwise have been brought to the <unk-44> <unk-619> will instead be sent to a new mental health facility -- the first step on a journey toward long-term treatment, not just punishment. <unk-108> says it's not the complete answer, but it's a start. <unk-108> says the best part is that it's a <unk-663> solution. The patients win, the families are <unk-671> and the state saves money by simply not cycling these prisoners through again and again. And, for <unk-689> justice is <unk-692> E-mail to a friend .

He's wearing a facial mask often used to help burn victims. It's the best birthday present the Iraqi family could ever have imagined for their <unk-87> <unk-10> turns 6 next Friday. "I was so happy I didn't know what to do with <unk-104> his mother, <unk-107> told CNN, a broad smile across her face. "I didn't think the reaction would be this <unk-124> His father said he was on the roof of his house when CNN called him with the news about the outpouring of support for his son.

The family eventually told CNN their story -- that <unk-10> was grabbed by masked men outside their home on January 15, doused in gasoline and set on fire. <unk-254> by coming forward, his parents put themselves in incredible danger.

Shortly after <unk-274> story aired Wednesday, the Children's <unk-294> Foundation -- a nonprofit organization based in Sherman <unk-303> California, that provides support for burn victims <unk-311> nationally and internationally -- agreed to pay for the transportation for <unk-10> and his family to come to the United States and to set up a fund for <unk-340> You can make a donation at the <unk-348> site by <unk-351> here.

But this family -- which saw the very worst in humanity on that January day -- has new hope in the world. That is partly due to the tens of thousands of CNN.com users who were so moved by the story and wanted to act.

S-5	(CNN) -- The National Football League has indefinitely suspended Atlanta <unk-10> quarterback Michael <unk-13> without pay, officials with the league said Friday. NFL star Michael <unk-13> is set to appear in court Monday. A judge will have the final say on a plea deal. Earlier, <unk-13> admitted to participating in a <unk-51> ring as part of a plea agreement with federal prosecutors in Virginia. <unk-64> admitted conduct was not only <unk-70> but also cruel and <unk-75> Your team, the <unk-79> and NFL fans have all been hurt by your <unk-89> NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a letter to <unk-99> Goodell said he would review the status of the suspension after the legal proceedings are over. In papers filed Friday with a federal court in Virginia, <unk-13> also admitted that he and two <unk-133> killed dogs that did not fight well. <unk-10> owner Arthur <unk-144> said <unk-146> admissions describe actions that are <unk-152> and <unk-154> The suspension makes "a strong statement that conduct which <unk-164> the good reputation of the NFL will not be <unk-174> he said in a statement. Watch what led to <unk-146> suspension » . Goodell said the <unk-10> could <unk-193> any claims or <unk-197> to recover <unk-200> million of <unk-146> signing bonus from the <unk-208> <unk-209> million contract he signed in 2004, according to The Associated Press. <unk-13> said he would plead guilty to one count of <unk-231> to Travel in Interstate Commerce in Aid of <unk-240> <unk-241> and to <unk-244> a Dog in an Animal Fighting <unk-251> in a plea agreement filed at U.S. District Court in Richmond, Virginia. The charge is <unk-267> by up to five years in prison, a $250,000 fine, <unk-278> <unk-279> a special assessment and 3 years of supervised <unk-288> the plea deal said. Federal prosecutors agreed to ask for the low end of the sentencing <unk-305> "The defendant will plead guilty because the defendant is in fact guilty of the charged <unk-321> the plea agreement said. In an additional summary of <unk-331> signed by <unk-13> and filed with the agreement, <unk-13> admitted buying pit bulls and the property used for training and fighting the dogs, but the statement said he did not bet on the fights or receive any of the money won. "Most of the <unk-376> <unk-377> <unk-378> operations and gambling <unk-382> were provided by <unk-386> the official summary of facts said. <unk-393> wins were generally split among <unk-133> Tony Taylor, <unk-402> Phillips and sometimes <unk-406> <unk-407> it continued. <unk-410> did not <unk-413> by placing side bets on any of the <unk-422> <unk-13> did not receive any of the proceeds from the <unk-433> that were won by <unk-376> <unk-377> <unk-440> " <unk-13> also agreed that <unk-446> <unk-447> by him and two others caused the deaths of at least six dogs. Around April, <unk-463> Peace and Phillips tested some dogs in fighting sessions at <unk-146> property in Virginia, the statement said. <unk-481> Phillips and <unk-13> agreed to the killing of approximately <unk-491> dogs that did not perform well in <unk-499> sessions at <unk-502> <unk-503> Road and all of those dogs were killed by various <unk-514> including hanging and <unk-518> <unk-410> agrees and <unk-522> that these dogs all died as a result of the collective efforts of <unk-407> Phillips and <unk-386> the summary said. <unk-407> 35, of Virginia Beach, <unk-548> Phillips, 28, of Atlanta, <unk-553> and Taylor, 34, of <unk-558> Virginia, already have accepted agreements to plead guilty in exchange for reduced <unk-571> <unk-463> 27, is scheduled to appear Monday in court, where he is expected to plead guilty before a judge. See a timeline of the case against <unk-13> » . The judge in the case will have the final say over the plea agreement. The federal case against <unk-13> focused on the <unk-623> <unk-624> but <unk-146> admission that he was involved in the killing of dogs could lead to local charges, according to CNN legal analyst Jeffrey <unk-648> "It sometimes happens -- not often -- that the state will follow a federal prosecution by charging its own crimes for exactly the same <unk-673> <unk-674> said Friday. "The risk for <unk-13> is, if he makes admissions in his federal guilty <unk-690> the state of Virginia could say, <unk-697> look, you admitted violating Virginia state law as well. We're going to introduce that against you and charge you in our <unk-719> " In the plea deal, <unk-13> agreed to cooperate with investigators and provide all information he may have on any criminal activity and to testify if necessary. <unk-13> also agreed to turn over any documents he has and to submit to <unk-761> tests. <unk-13> agreed to <unk-766> <unk-767> for the full amount of the costs <unk-775> with the dogs that are being held by the government. <unk-786> costs may <unk-789> but are not limited to, all costs associated with the care of the dogs involved in that case, including if necessary, the long-term care and/or the <unk-816> <unk-817> of some or all of those <unk-824> <unk-825> with the support of animal rights activists, have asked for permission to <unk-838> the dogs. But the dogs could serve as important evidence in the cases against <unk-13> and his admitted <unk-857> Judge Henry E. Hudson issued an order Thursday telling the U.S. <unk-869> Service to <unk-872> and seize the defendant property, and use discretion and whatever means appropriate to protect and maintain said defendant <unk-891> Both the judge's order and <unk-146> filing refer to <unk-901> 53 pit bull dogs. After <unk-146> indictment last month, Goodell ordered the quarterback not to report to the <unk-10> training camp, and the league is reviewing the case. <unk-144> told the NFL Network on Monday he could not speculate on <unk-146> future as a <unk-946> at least not until he had seen "a statement of <unk-957> in the case.

She was <unk-322> the first time when she was cleaning an office. "They took advantage of me," she says <unk-339> "At first I rejected it, but then I realized I have to do it." Both <unk-77> and <unk-357> have clients that call them a couple times a week. Other women resort to trips to the market to find potential clients.

S-8	WASHINGTON (CNN) -- As he awaits a crucial progress report on Iraq, President Bush will try to put a twist on comparisons of the war to Vietnam by <unk-28> the historical lessons of that conflict to argue against pulling out. President Bush <unk-42> Tuesday during a news conference at the North American Leaders summit in Canada. On Wednesday in Kansas City, Missouri, Bush will tell members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars that <unk-73> as now, people argued that the real problem was America's presence and that if we would just <unk-91> the killing would <unk-95> according to speech <unk-99> released Tuesday by the White House. <unk-106> decades later, there is a legitimate debate about how we got into the Vietnam War and how we <unk-125> Bush will say. <unk-129> your position in that debate, one <unk-136> legacy of Vietnam is that the price of America's withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens, whose <unk-155> would add to our <unk-160> new terms like <unk-164> people,' <unk-166> <unk-167> and <unk-169> <unk-170> " the president will say. The president will also make the argument that withdrawing from Vietnam <unk-187> today's terrorists by <unk-191> U.S. <unk-193> citing a quote from al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden that the American people would rise against the Iraq war the same way they rose against the war in Vietnam, according to the <unk-227> <unk-228> at home, some can argue our withdrawal from Vietnam carried no price to American <unk-193> but the terrorists see things <unk-249> Bush will say. On Tuesday, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said, <unk-262> Bush's attempt to compare the war in Iraq to past military conflicts in East Asia <unk-278> the fundamental difference between the two. Our nation was misled by the Bush Administration in an effort to gain support for the invasion of Iraq under false <unk-306> leading to one of the worst foreign policy <unk-315> in our history. "While the President continues to <unk-324> with his failed strategy in Iraq, paid for by the <unk-335> American lives are being lost and there is still no political solution within the Iraqi government. It is time to change direction in Iraq, and Congress will again work to do so in the <unk-370> The White House is <unk-375> the speech, along with another address next week to the American <unk-387> as an effort to <unk-392> broader <unk-394> for the debate over the upcoming Iraq progress report by Gen. David <unk-407> the top U.S. military <unk-412> and Ryan <unk-415> the U.S. ambassador in Baghdad. President Bush has frequently asked lawmakers -- and the American people -- to <unk-434> judgment on his troop <unk-439> in Iraq until the report comes out in September. Watch Bush criticize the Iraqi government » . It is being closely watched on Capitol Hill, particularly by Republicans nervous about the political fallout from an increasingly unpopular war. Earlier this month, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said he would wait for the report before deciding when a <unk-496> of the <unk-499> U.S. troops in Iraq might <unk-505> Bush's speeches Wednesday and next week are the latest in a series of attempts by the White House to try to <unk-527> the debate over Iraq, as public support for the war continues to <unk-540> A recent <unk-543> Research Corporation poll found that almost two-thirds of Americans -- 64 percent -- now oppose the Iraq war, and 72 percent say that even if Petraeus reports progress, it won't change their opinion.

S-15	(CNN) -- A virus found in healthy Australian honey bees may be playing a role in the collapse of honey bee <unk-21> across the United States, researchers reported Thursday.

The disorder is marked by <unk-146> left with a <unk-150> a few newly <unk-154> adults and plenty of food, but the worker bees responsible for <unk-166> gone. The virus identified in the healthy Australian bees is Israeli <unk-178> <unk-179> <unk-180> <unk-181> -- named that because it was discovered by <unk-190> University <unk-192> Although worker bees in colony collapse disorder <unk-200> bees infected with <unk-204> die close to the <unk-209> after developing <unk-212> wings and <unk-215> For some reason, the Australian bees seem to be resistant to <unk-204> and do not come down with symptoms. Scientists used genetic <unk-238> of bees collected over the past three years and found that <unk-204> was present in bees that had come from colony collapse disorder <unk-146> 96 percent of the time. But the study released Thursday on the Science Express Web site, operated by the journal <unk-283> cautioned that collapse disorder is likely caused by several <unk-293> "This research give us a very good lead to <unk-303> but we do not believe <unk-204> is acting <unk-312> said <unk-314> S. <unk-316> of the U.S. Department of <unk-322> <unk-39> Research Laboratory and a co-author of the study. <unk-332> <unk-333> on the colony are likely <unk-339> This could explain why bees in Australia may be resistant to colony collapse.

Lindsay Lohan may still get work after her legal problems are <unk-44> but the cost will be high. It is an important question, too, because whether companies <unk-6> <unk-61> future movies may determine whether she will quickly fall off Hollywood's <unk-73> But Lohan fans have little to fear because no actor is <unk-85> say <unk-87> experts. While some producers may <unk-93> at conditions for hiring <unk-98> stars, experts say that unless an actor is serving time in prison, even the most volatile can be covered -- albeit at a high cost. "For a price, anything can be done, although an insurance carrier can make things so <unk-139> that at times the makers of the film just won't be <unk-151> said Ross Miller, partner with insurance <unk-158> <unk-159> <unk-160> & <unk-162> Inc. <unk-61> arrest this week in Los Angeles on suspicion of drunken driving and cocaine possession has left Hollywood wondering if the actress, who shot to fame as a child in Disney films like "The <unk-198> <unk-199> is too risky to cast in a film. <unk-208> Lindsay <unk-61> troubles » .

Police released this mug shot of <unk-8> Simpson after his arrest. Simpson is accused of having directed several other men in an alleged armed robbery of sports memorabilia in a room at a Las Vegas hotel room.

He was released on his own <unk-295> and returned to <unk-299> either Saturday night or early Sunday morning, <unk-254> said. In addition, investigators are seeking four other men they believe accompanied Simpson into the hotel room, Nichols said. Nichols said, "There is a social relationship between the individuals that we identified and <unk-8> <unk-342> Though Simpson is not accused of having <unk-350> a gun himself, two firearms that police said were used were recovered early Sunday in one of three <unk-369> Investigators would would not <unk-374> where the weapons were found. Nichols dismissed an initial report that the men may have been off-duty police. "There is no truth to that <unk-399> he said.

S-26	(CNN) -- A former government contract employee was indicted on charges of stealing restricted nuclear <unk-15> materials and putting the United States at risk, the Department of Justice announced Thursday. Sources say the classified materials were taken from the East Tennessee Technology Park. Roy Lynn <unk-45> 67, of <unk-48> County, Tennessee, appeared in federal court in <unk-56> on Thursday. <unk-59> was briefly detained for questioning in the case in January, when authorities first learned of the alleged plot to <unk-79> the <unk-81> government sources told CNN. He voluntarily surrendered Thursday at an FBI field office in <unk-96> the sources said. <unk-59> is a former employee of <unk-106> <unk-107> the Department of <unk-111> prime environmental management contractor at the East Tennessee Technology Park, prosecutors said. The indictment states that <unk-45> <unk-129> possession of, access to and having been <unk-137> with sections of <unk-141> and associated hardware used for uranium enrichment through the process of <unk-153> <unk-154> ... having reason to believe that such data would be <unk-165> to <unk-167> the United States and secure an advantage to a foreign nation, did <unk-180> <unk-181> and disclose such data to another <unk-188> The transfer took place January 26, the indictment <unk-197> <unk-59> is also charged with converting the material and <unk-207> <unk-208> to his own use. He began doing so on about October 17, 2006, and continued through January, prosecutors said. Prosecutors said the materials involved have been examined by scientists and posed no threat to people who may have come into contact with them. <unk-252> attorney, <unk-254> <unk-255> said outside court Thursday that <unk-252> job was to break <unk-266> <unk-267> little <unk-269> and throw them away. <unk-274> said <unk-59> had a security <unk-280> but <unk-274> did not believe it was a high-level <unk-290> The government alleges that in January, <unk-59> attempted to sell the <unk-302> of <unk-304> to someone he thought was a French agent -- but in reality was an undercover FBI agent, <unk-274> said. He said he questions whether those broken pieces would be considered an <unk-336> under the law. "Mr. <unk-59> has <unk-343> fully for the last six <unk-349> said <unk-255> who added that he had traveled to Washington for work on the case. Each count carries a possible sentence upon conviction of up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. "While none of the stolen equipment was ever transmitted to a foreign government or terrorist organization, the facts of this case demonstrate the importance of <unk-409> our nuclear technology and pursuing aggressive prosecution against those who attempt to breach the <unk-424> and put that technology in the wrong <unk-432> Kenneth <unk-434> assistant attorney general for national security, said in the Justice Department statement. One government source said the materials involved are not the <unk-457> <unk-458> but they should not have been taken from the facility. A <unk-470> is used to filter uranium during the enrichment process, according to nuclear energy officials, but a significant number of barriers are needed to do that job. Sources told CNN that federal authorities have been following <unk-59> and investigating the case for at least six months, after he allegedly tried to sell the classified material. <unk-45> described as a <unk-529> employee, apparently did not make contact with any foreign government and is not a foreign agent of any kind, an official familiar with the case said. A government official with with knowledge of the case said that when authorities learned of <unk-252> alleged intentions six months ago, the FBI and Department of Energy launched a joint investigation. The FBI then developed a sting operation, government officials familiar with the case said, and authorities intervened before there could be any involvement of a foreign country. East Tennessee Technology Park is an area of the <unk-623> Oak Ridge <unk-626> <unk-627> we are currently <unk-631> and <unk-633> buildings that were last used in <unk-640> Gerald <unk-642> manager of the <unk-623> Oak Ridge site office, said Thursday.

The U.S. Embassy in Bangkok said that five Americans were among those killed when the <unk-41> jet crashed in bad weather as it landed at <unk-112> airport on Sunday. U.S. officials had previously confirmed that four Americans died in the crash, and one survived. Eight British nationals are believed to have died, according to Foreign Secretary David <unk-144> He said three were still in hospital, with one in a critical condition.

One air traffic controller at <unk-15> airport said pilots were warned of possible wind <unk-350> which is dramatic changes in wind speed and direction. Airport officials said that the wind at the time of the crash was 17 kilometers an hour <unk-377> miles an <unk-380> with stronger <unk-383> but no planes were delayed or diverted because of the weather conditions. The decision to land was the <unk-402> alone, according to <unk-112> airport manager. <unk-409> traffic control would give weather information to pilot and warning information but the final decision is dependent on the <unk-429> <unk-430> <unk-431> said. <unk-41> officials would not speculate on what may have happened, saying they will wait for the findings of the investigation.

S-34	LONDON, England (CNN) -- French Foreign Minister Bernard <unk-8> declaration that France had to prepare for the possibility of war against Iran over its nuclear program was not conventional diplomatic behavior. But then <unk-33> was never expected to be a <unk-40> on the diplomatic scene. French foreign minister Bernard <unk-33> has a reputation for challenging convention and authority. A surprise appointment from the Socialist ranks to Nicolas <unk-67> conservative government, the founder of <unk-73> <unk-74> <unk-75> has always challenged convention and authority.

How much should be made of his words on Iran remains unclear at this stage. They were <unk-303> on the same scale as President <unk-228> threat when he was still in office to <unk-319> with nuclear strikes against any state found to be responsible for a large-scale terrorist attack on France. But they are all of a piece with France's new high-profile style under the presidency of Nicolas <unk-354> Mr <unk-356> for example, became the first French Foreign Minister to visit Iraq since 1988, insisting that there could only be a political solution to the country's problems, not a military one, and offering France's services as a <unk-393> and <unk-395> <unk-396> between <unk-398> <unk-399> and <unk-401> On Iran he is, in a way, merely <unk-410> the words of his President who declared in a speech last month that a <unk-425> Iran would be <unk-429> and describing the stand-off over its nuclear program as <unk-439> the most serious crisis before us <unk-446> <unk-447> Mr <unk-33> is making clear that France no longer takes the view once expressed by President <unk-464> that a <unk-425> Iran might be inevitable .

But both are <unk-530> the risks which are <unk-535> up as a result of <unk-541> <unk-542> Perhaps the strongest lesson though from Mr <unk-8> intervention is his <unk-554> that the new administration in France is not a <unk-564> <unk-565> one -- and that France is in the business of <unk-576> a role at the top diplomatic <unk-583> E-mail to a friend .

S-36	WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Some Democrats appear to be <unk-8> on a highly contentious House resolution <unk-15> Turkey's treatment of <unk-19> in World War I as <unk-25> A <unk-27> tanker lands at <unk-31> Air Base in southern Turkey in 2003. Turkey, a longtime U.S. ally and NATO partner, was <unk-48> by the resolution calling the killing of <unk-19> by <unk-58> <unk-59> genocide and threatened to block access to <unk-31> Air Base after the resolution passed a House committee vote. The base, in southern Turkey near Syria, is a major <unk-88> center for U.S. operations in Iraq and elsewhere in the <unk-99> and Asia. The Pentagon is preparing to set up new supply routes for troops in Iraq if Turkey cuts off U.S. access to the <unk-124> important <unk-126> military officials said Tuesday. <unk-131> acknowledges the killings of <unk-19> during World War I but vehemently objects to the <unk-146> <unk-147> The House Foreign Affairs Committee last week adopted the <unk-157> <unk-158> House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she would bring the measure to a vote of the full House sometime next month.

Majority Leader <unk-204> <unk-205> signaled Tuesday that the vote might be put off. "I said I thought we would bring this up prior to us leaving here," said <unk-205> of <unk-232> "I have not changed on that, although I would be less than candid to say that there are a number of people who are <unk-257> their own positions.

S-37	WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A <unk-4> presidential race and a willingness by candidates, interest groups, unions and corporations to buy TV time will lead to historic spending for political and <unk-29> advertising in the 2008 election <unk-35> an analysis shows. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney has spent the most on TV advertising so far among presidential <unk-55> The cost to try to influence the 2008 election could exceed $3 billion, according to <unk-71> Media <unk-73> Media Analysis Group, CNN's consultant on political television <unk-82> This is nearly twice as much than what was spent in 2004 when political and <unk-29> television advertising rang in at <unk-104> billion. In 2006, <unk-108> billion was spent on political and <unk-29> TV <unk-117> Just about every candidate running for an office from <unk-127> to president is spending the money, said Evan <unk-136> <unk-137> chief operating officer. The costs to produce a TV commercial are no longer <unk-151> for local and state candidates, who are turning more and more to the <unk-165> to reach voters. See how spending breaks down for this year » . And interest groups have spent <unk-184> million on TV ads so far this year for state and local ballot measures. On the national level, the cost of <unk-29> television ad spending was <unk-211> million in the first nine months of this year. <unk-221> ranged from the Iraq war to <unk-228> reform. Television ads on health care alone total $60 million. <unk-239> estimates more than $3 million of the <unk-211> million spent to air <unk-29> ads this year has gone for <unk-259> in states and districts that are likely to have competitive House and Senate races in 2008. Tracey said he thinks this is just the beginning of interest groups <unk-288> from legislative advocacy mode to political <unk-295> "What we expect to see between now and the end of the <unk-308> and through the general election, is groups will take a more aggressive stance on their advertising and actually target <unk-328> he said. With 17 Democratic and Republican candidates running for president, <unk-239> predicts that more than <unk-345> million will be spent on TV ads in the battle for the White House. Up to now, the political <unk-259> have been largely focused on the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Voters in some of the <unk-386> states holding <unk-389> <unk-390> on February 5 will start seeing ads in the coming months. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney leads all candidates in TV spending, having aired his <unk-259> more than 11,000 times this year at a cost of nearly <unk-428> million. This is a record for the number of <unk-438> at this point in a presidential election <unk-446> Watch how Romney is way ahead in ad spending » . In contrast, one of Romney's chief rivals for the GOP <unk-468> former New York Mayor Rudy <unk-474> has spent nothing on television <unk-480> but <unk-482> leads in the national polls and is within striking distance of the lead in several state <unk-499> <unk-482> enjoys widespread national name <unk-505> while Romney does not. In the race for the Democratic <unk-468> Illinois Sen. Barack Obama has spent more than <unk-108> million on television <unk-529> while New York Sen. Hillary Clinton has spent $1 million less and leads in both national and early state <unk-549> New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson has probably benefited the most in the Democratic contest from the $2 million he has invested in his television <unk-117> <unk-575> <unk-576> TV ads effectively stated his experience as a <unk-585> diplomat and executive, and positioned him as a solid <unk-595> candidate. Romney used his <unk-428> million in television ads to introduce himself as a social and fiscal conservative to Republican voters. These voters might otherwise not know much about him other than that he was the governor of the traditionally liberal Massachusetts. Romney is leading polls in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire. Further evidence of how Romney's television <unk-259> have helped is in South Carolina. An American Research Group poll of South Carolina Republicans in August showed Romney <unk-678> at 9 percent with these influential primary voters. A month later, and with <unk-692> worth of <unk-259> aired in the two weeks leading up to the next poll, Romney was up 17 percentage points. Romney's latest ad began airing Friday in Iowa, and in it he vows to stop Iran from <unk-730> nuclear weapons, to boost the military by 100,000 people, to strengthen U.S. intelligence capabilities and to monitor calls into the U.S. from al Qaeda. All of these issues should play well with conservatives who participate in the Iowa <unk-769> While only a handful of Democratic candidates and Romney have used the <unk-165> until now, Tracey said he expects this to change. <unk-792> the end of October, I suspect all the <unk-801> candidates will be on the <unk-807> Tracey said. "As we get closer to primary day, the <unk-818> will be joined by all the candidates in the race who are taking their last, best <unk-835> In the fight for Congress, <unk-239> predicts that as much as <unk-847> million could be spent on television <unk-82> Democrats control the House and Senate. Tracey noted that <unk-137> 2008 election cycle forecast does not take into account <unk-874> events such as former Florida Rep. Mark <unk-882> House page scandal or the September 11 terrorist attacks. <unk-892> is completely <unk-895> to <unk-897> he said. <unk-900> will ultimately determine how much is <unk-907> where and <unk-910> What television advertising challenges do candidates and interest groups face in the coming <unk-924> <unk-925> are, just as what happened in 2006, voters will be <unk-936> after watching hundred and hundreds of <unk-943> said Stuart <unk-946> editor of the <unk-950> <unk-951> Political <unk-953> "The sheer number of ads probably <unk-960> their <unk-962> After a while, the ads just become lots of <unk-972> and an ad will have to be really good to cut through the <unk-986> E-mail to a friend .

Such a discovery would usually <unk-30> <unk-31> even wonder perhaps, but it <unk-37> mixed feelings for the <unk-42> The island was once thought to be a peninsula attached to <unk-54> by an ice shelf or a <unk-61> But such a large amount of ice <unk-69> it revealed the distinct island.

Most of the scientific community believes that some warming is occurring across the globe and through some layers of the atmosphere. But why it is occurring and what that means for the future is <unk-278> and politically <unk-281> The Earth's temperature <unk-285> about 60 degrees <unk-289> (about 16 degrees <unk-293> The average surface temperature has <unk-299> one degree <unk-289> <unk-303> degrees <unk-305> during the last century, according to the National Research Council.

They rose till about <unk-336> <unk-337> until about 1975 and have risen steadily to present day. There are several possible reasons for the <unk-355> scientists say. A change in the Earth's orbit or the intensity of the <unk-369> radiation could change, triggering warming or <unk-376> The reason most cited -- by scientists and scientific organizations -- for the current warming trend is an increase in the <unk-398> of greenhouse <unk-401> which are in the atmosphere naturally and help keep the planet's temperature at a comfortable level. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, for instance, has increased by 35 percent since the dawn of the industrial age, according to the United <unk-444> <unk-445> <unk-446> on Climate <unk-449> commonly referred to as the <unk-455> The presence of methane is now <unk-462> percent above <unk-465> levels, but the rate of increase has slowed in recent decades, according to the <unk-480> Meanwhile, <unk-482> <unk-483> increased by about 18 percent during the past 200 years. Many scientists and experts who have studied global warming believe the increase is primarily the result of human activities, like the burning of fossil <unk-518> emissions from vehicles and the clearing of <unk-526> "For the last 30 years, there's no way there's anything natural that can explain it," Stephen <unk-543> a professor of environmental studies at Stanford University in California, said.

S-40	<unk-0> Chad (CNN) -- Most of the <unk-7> children that a French charity attempted to take to France from Chad for adoption are neither Sudanese nor <unk-26> three international aid agencies reported on Thursday. Hundreds of women protest child trafficking and shout <unk-42> slogans Wednesday in <unk-46> <unk-47> Six members of <unk-51> <unk-52> were arrested last week as they tried to put the children on a plane to France, where the charity said host families were waiting to take the children in. Three French journalists, a <unk-86> Spanish flight crew and one Belgian were also arrested. Representatives of the journalists and flight crew said they were unaware of problems with <unk-51> <unk-52> and thought they were on a humanitarian mission. <unk-120> President <unk-122> <unk-123> hopes the journalists and the flight crew will be <unk-133> his chief of staff, <unk-138> <unk-139> said Thursday. The president would legally be able to intervene in the case if it is transferred from a judge in the eastern city of <unk-46> where the children were taken, to a judge in <unk-175> the capital, <unk-178> said. The transfer will take place Monday, according to media reports. The International Red Cross Committee, the U.N. High Commissioner for <unk-200> and <unk-202> said most of the children were living with their families before <unk-51> <unk-52> took them. The charity said the children were Sudanese <unk-225> that it was trying to rescue from a war-torn nation. The agencies said most of the children also probably come from <unk-120> villages along <unk-250> border with <unk-253> The children have been living in an orphanage in <unk-263> while authorities and aid agencies try to determine their <unk-273> Watch a report on whether the children are <unk-225> » . <unk-120> authorities immediately accused the charity of kidnapping the children and <unk-296> their <unk-273> <unk-250> interior minister said <unk-51> <unk-52> dressed the children in <unk-309> and fake <unk-312> <unk-313> to make them look like refugees who needed medical help. The charity workers and journalists have been charged with kidnapping and extortion and could face 20 years of hard labor if convicted. The <unk-347> and Belgian are charged with <unk-353> The Spanish flight crew is innocent and should be released, a company executive said Thursday. "We thought we were doing a humanitarian <unk-376> said <unk-378> <unk-379> sales director of Spain's <unk-384> Jet charter firm. "If an <unk-390> <unk-391> <unk-392> has done something wrong, it's impossible for us to <unk-402> Spain's Foreign Ministry has publicly expressed its disagreement with the charges and has dispatched top diplomats to Chad to try to win the group's release. Over the weekend, the captain appealed urgently to be <unk-437> fearing the crew could be harmed or killed, <unk-446> said. But the four women and three men are in good condition in custody, <unk-446> said, based on his conversations with a Spanish consular official who came from Cameroon to Chad and has been able to visit them. The detention is the first problem of its kind for the company, which hopes government negotiations can resolve the issue, <unk-446> said. On its Web site, <unk-51> <unk-52> describes itself as a nonprofit organization based in Paris that sends teams of <unk-526> <unk-527> firefighters and other specialists to care for children in war zones and place them with families in France, who then apply for asylum on their behalf. The Red Cross, <unk-557> and <unk-202> said the 21 girls and 82 boys range in age from about 1 year to about 10, and they are healthy. The agencies said they have been interviewing the children individually to determine their <unk-594> "So far, the interviews carried out with the children -- some of whom could not provide any information due to their young age -- led to the preliminary conclusion that probably 85 come from <unk-120> villages near the cities of <unk-635> and <unk-637> along the <unk-640> <unk-641> the agencies said. <unk-645> children said they had been living with their family, consisting of at least one adult they considered to be their <unk-666> the agencies said, adding that interviews with the remaining 12 children were ongoing. The agencies called their investigation <unk-685> and challenging because of the number of children, their youth and the situation in the region. Other French charities earlier had questioned whether <unk-51> <unk-52> could legally arrange adoption of children from <unk-718> and contacted French authorities, according to French newspapers and The Associated Press. French authorities have reacted angrily to the <unk-51> <unk-52> trip, calling the group's actions <unk-745> and <unk-747> The French Foreign Ministry has said the dispute will not affect France's participation in a European <unk-764> force due to be deployed along the border between Chad and <unk-253> In response to the dispute in <unk-783> the Republic of Congo said late Wednesday it was <unk-793> all international <unk-796> The Associated Press reported.

The third journalist, <unk-855> <unk-856> of the TV station France 3 <unk-863> was traveling with the group in a personal <unk-872> though she carried a camera from her station, Reporters Without Borders said.

S-48	<unk-0> Somalia (CNN) -- An enraged crowd dragged the body of an Ethiopian soldier through the streets of <unk-18> capital Thursday after gun battles with Islamic insurgents killed 19 people, witnesses reported. In a brutal echo of a 1993 battle involving Somali militias in which the bodies of U.S. troops were dragged through the streets, crowds Thursday shouted <unk-58> is <unk-60> as they pulled the <unk-65> <unk-66> corpse through a <unk-70> <unk-71> neighborhood. The body was bound hand and foot with wire and wrapped in a sheet of plastic when insurgents pulled it out of a car and left it with the crowd in the northern <unk-71> neighborhood of <unk-109> <unk-110> witnesses reported. Nine <unk-114> are reportedly part of the 19 dead. Another battle broke out on the city's south side Thursday morning between Ethiopian troops and insurgents armed with heavy machine guns and <unk-144> <unk-145> The fighting drove hundreds more people from their homes, on top of the tens of thousands aid agencies say have fled in recent weeks. <unk-170> will launch violent attacks on us, for some of their comrades have been killed today," said <unk-187> Nor <unk-189> an elderly woman in the capital. "They will be like wounded <unk-201> Witnesses put the death toll from the day's clashes at 19, including Ethiopian troops, insurgents and civilians. Ethiopian troops arrived in Somalia in December 2006 to help a weak Somali government drive the Islamic <unk-236> Union out of <unk-71> and restore a <unk-244> transitional government after a decade and a half of <unk-254> The Islamists responded by launching an insurgency against Somali government and Ethiopian troops that has lasted nearly a year. The United States accused the <unk-279> of <unk-281> suspected al Qaeda figures, including three men wanted in the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, and raised no objections to Ethiopian presence in Somalia.

S-49	<unk-0> Illinois (CNN) -- The disappearance of a suburban Chicago police <unk-11> wife is now being treated as a potential <unk-20> and her husband is a suspect, authorities said Friday. Stacy <unk-31> 23, has been missing from her suburban Chicago home since October 28. In another development, a judge signed an order to <unk-53> the body of Drew <unk-58> third wife, who was found drowned in a bathtub in 2004, said Will County State Attorney James <unk-76> <unk-31> 53, said he last spoke to 23-year-old Stacy Peterson -- his fourth wife -- the night of October 28. Drew Peterson initially told the media he believed his wife ran off with another man, but he hasn't repeated that <unk-117> CNN has been unable to contact Drew Peterson for comment. The couple have been married four years and have two children, who have been interviewed for the investigation, Glasgow said. Drew Peterson also has older children from a previous marriage. Investigators have twice searched the couple's home and vehicles, and removed several items, including computers, said Illinois State Police Capt. Carl <unk-179> Drew Peterson allowed a limited search on the night his wife was reported missing, but investigators were not allowed to look throughout the entire house and were given access to only one of the vehicles at that time, <unk-218> said. <unk-220> on, we looked at this as a missing persons case, but also believed strongly ... it was strongly starting to look at Drew Peterson as being a person of <unk-250> <unk-218> said. "I would say that right now, Drew Peterson has gone from being a person of interest to being a <unk-272> New information turned up during the investigation also raised questions about the death of <unk-58> third wife, Kathleen <unk-291> which was ruled an accident by a coroner's jury, Glasgow said. "There are strong indications that it was a <unk-311> he said. "That's why we are doing the <unk-320> because there are tests that need to be done that weren't done during the first <unk-336> Watch why authorities want to <unk-53> the body » . Glasgow cited <unk-349> on <unk-351> body and a <unk-355> on her head that could not be readily explained. "Our main thrust is to determine whether or not it was a <unk-20> and as we do that, we will see if there is any evidence that <unk-392> <unk-393> he said. Glasgow, who was not state attorney at the time of <unk-351> death, said he reviewed the case file before deciding to reopen the case. "With 29 years of experience, there was no doubt in my mind it wasn't an <unk-435> he said. "That was <unk-440> In 2002, <unk-443> was charged once with battery and once with domestic battery against her husband, but was found not guilty at trial, Glasgow said. Another time, she tried to bring domestic battery charges against <unk-31> but no charges were ever <unk-482> <unk-351> sister, Sue <unk-486> said <unk-443> expressed fear of Drew <unk-493> "She told me all the time, 'He's gonna kill me.

The reason behind the jump in the number of Iraqis at the school is a new government <unk-178> For the first time since the start of the Iraq war, Jordan is allowing all Iraqi children -- regardless of refugee status -- to <unk-203> in <unk-138> schools. <unk-207> this means that even illegal refugees with no paperwork can send their kids to school with no questions asked. The move is <unk-230> a massive population shift in the Middle East. More than <unk-241> million Iraqis have fled the violence in their <unk-250> most of them seeking refuge in neighboring Jordan and Syria, according to humanitarian officials. Jordanian Minister of Education Khalid <unk-270> says he expects Jordan to accommodate 40,000 to 50,000 Iraqi students this year. That's more than double the number of Iraqi children enrolled in public school two years ago. <unk-300> on the front line of the <unk-307> says the influx is putting a strain on her school.

S-57	<unk-0> Jordan (CNN) -- In the <unk-6> <unk-7> of the <unk-10> Institute for Girls in <unk-15> Jordan, principal <unk-18> Abu <unk-20> makes an announcement over the speaker system. Iraqi students at the <unk-10> school in <unk-35> gather around a teacher. One in 5 students there is <unk-46> "All Iraqi girls come outside now. All Iraqi girls.

Watch Iraqi girls describe a long way from home » . The reason behind the jump in the number of Iraqis at the school is a new government <unk-178> For the first time since the start of the Iraq war, Jordan is allowing all Iraqi children -- regardless of refugee status -- to <unk-203> in <unk-138> schools. <unk-207> this means that even illegal refugees with no paperwork can send their kids to school with no questions asked. The move is <unk-230> a massive population shift in the Middle East. More than <unk-241> million Iraqis have fled the violence in their <unk-250> most of them seeking refuge in neighboring Jordan and Syria, according to humanitarian officials. Jordanian Minister of Education Khalid <unk-270> says he expects Jordan to accommodate 40,000 to 50,000 Iraqi students this year. That's more than double the number of Iraqi children enrolled in public school two years ago. <unk-300> on the front line of the <unk-307> says the influx is putting a strain on her school. Even with some U.N. and U.S. aid to Jordan, there's still not enough money. "We need more teachers here, more resources, more buildings, more chairs for all Iraqi students and our <unk-349> she says. In a nearby neighborhood, in the study room of the Ahmed <unk-363> School for <unk-366> a handful of Iraqi kids talk of their experience living far from home. <unk-380> at a <unk-383> table covered with a red and white <unk-391> the boys tell stories of horror and <unk-399> <unk-400> <unk-401> lost five immediate family members before moving to Jordan to try to live a normal life. <unk-418> and with a <unk-422> <unk-423> he <unk-60> the <unk-427> <unk-428> <unk-429> Most of the boys and young men from Iraq have missed several years of school -- up to a four-year educational gap that will delay not only their high school <unk-460> but also their entry into the <unk-467> All say, though, that they feel lucky to have gotten out, even if the violence in their country means always having to be on the move, ready to live far from home and away from loved ones. "It's not strange for me to be in the middle of people I don't <unk-519> says <unk-521> <unk-522> <unk-523> <unk-524> Al <unk-526> "I had friends in Iraq when I was small, I left them. In America, I left them. I came here, I left them." He <unk-551> "But you have to miss your country." The United Nations High Commissioner for <unk-565> estimates up to 250,000 <unk-570> Iraqi children are in <unk-575> Many of them are enrolled in private <unk-583> But as families run out of money they had when they left Iraq, they turn to public schools. Even so, more than a month into the new academic year, fewer Iraqi families than first anticipated enrolled their kids in schools this year. According to the charity Save the <unk-632> <unk-633> Iraqi children have so far enrolled in Jordanian <unk-642> As a result, the government extended the deadline for student applications and cut down on the required paperwork for Iraqi families. The lower registration numbers were attributed in part to illegal <unk-674> fears of being identified through their children's school records. <unk-684> of what the final number will be this year, the population shift in the Middle East is, according to <unk-704> head Antonio <unk-707> the largest urban refugee situation in the world. Iraqi families are changing the social fabric of Jordanian society. About 10 percent of Jordan's population is now made up of Iraqi refugees -- the estimates range from 500,000 to <unk-746> of them. The schoolchildren are living examples of how the Iraq war may permanently change the Middle East. <unk-765> children will be incorporated and integrated within our mainstream line of <unk-777> says <unk-779> the education minister.

S-59	<unk-0> Scotland -- World champions Italy clinched qualification for Euro 2008 after goals in the first and last minutes gave them a <unk-22> 2-1 victory at <unk-26> Park -- killing off Scotland's hopes of reaching the <unk-36> <unk-37> Toni celebrates his early goal as Italy won 2-1 in Scotland to clinch qualification from Group B. <unk-37> Toni shot Italy in front but Scotland recovered to dominate and Barry Ferguson bundled home a <unk-72> <unk-73> However, Christian <unk-76> headed an <unk-79> winner after a controversial decision to award Italy a <unk-89> The result also means France have sealed <unk-97> along with Italy, from Group B without playing a game. In a match played in torrential rain, Italy enjoyed the best possible start by taking the lead after just 70 seconds. <unk-129> <unk-130> spotted Antonio Di <unk-134> unmarked in the box, and picked him out with a <unk-145> as Scotland were caught <unk-150> Di <unk-134> swept the ball into the path of Toni who <unk-162> <unk-163> into the top left corner from six meters out. The home side almost conceded a second goal 60 seconds later. This time, Toni turned provider and his <unk-191> was met by <unk-195> <unk-196> who fired over from <unk-201> Toni then <unk-204> off two challenges before drawing a decent save from Craig Gordon with a <unk-218> effort that the goalkeeper did well to block at the near post. At the other end, Scotland were denied the opportunity to haul themselves back into the match when a <unk-249> drive from Lee <unk-253> appeared to be handled by <unk-130> inside the area but penalty claims were <unk-267> <unk-268> on by a sense of <unk-274> the hosts <unk-277> up the pressure on their visitors. Ferguson fired over from a James <unk-290> corner, before Alan <unk-294> <unk-295> <unk-296> wide of the upright following another perfect delivery from the Everton man. Scotland then produced some wonderful passing football, which <unk-317> in a <unk-320> drive from Ferguson, but <unk-325> <unk-326> dived low to <unk-330> Then came another scare for the home side. Gordon was forced to pull a save out of the top <unk-350> to deny a <unk-354> effort from <unk-357> <unk-358> before Di <unk-134> <unk-362> the <unk-364> into the back of the net. The assistant referee raised his flag for offside but television <unk-381> suggested the official may have called it wrong. Only <unk-391> defending from the Italians prevented the Scots from grabbing a <unk-402> <unk-403> on the stroke of <unk-408> David Weir rose above everyone else in a packed box to meet Ferguson's corner and his header appeared to be heading for the top corner before Andrea <unk-436> somehow managed to nod off the line. A free-kick in a dangerous area provided Italy with the chance to start the second half as <unk-461> as they had started the first when Paul Hartley hauled down <unk-196> just outside the box. <unk-436> seized on the chance and <unk-484> the ball over the wall but, despite a reputation as a <unk-496> <unk-497> his effort was easily dealt with by <unk-505> Instead, it was Scotland who found the back of the net as <unk-26> erupted with 65 minutes gone. <unk-524> free-kick deflected into the path of <unk-253> in front of goal. He was denied by <unk-540> but the <unk-364> fell <unk-545> to Ferguson and the captain <unk-551> <unk-362> home from <unk-201> With just over 15 minutes to go, Scott Brown was withdrawn for Kenny Miller as Scotland went for <unk-574> The Derby striker quickly began to cause the Italians problems and delivered a wonderful <unk-589> cross to the feet of <unk-290> but he fired wide when it looked easier score.

The girl, now 7, was shown in a sex video made four years ago, Detective David <unk-80> said at a news conference Friday night. She was found Friday with family in Las Vegas after thousands of tips poured in, thanks to an appeal by police to the news media to show the girl's picture. CNN and other news organizations did so until the child was found, when De <unk-62> asked them to stop showing the picture. "The mother has <unk-143> with us," De <unk-62> said.

S-75	<unk-0> <unk-1> California (CNN) -- You must know what's really driving the immigration debate. It's the culture, <unk-17> Ruben <unk-19> <unk-20> Some opponents of immigration, even the legal kind, fear changes in local culture. Immigration <unk-35> -- and by that, I mean those who want to limit all immigration, even the legal kind -- like to pretend they're so <unk-59> Yet they can't help themselves. They always take the low road and <unk-72> back to the <unk-76> that greeted earlier waves of immigrants. The <unk-35> insist that what <unk-88> them are merely practical <unk-93> that our borders aren't <unk-98> that so many immigrants are coming into the country <unk-108> and that the new arrivals are <unk-115> schools and <unk-118> social services once they get here. <unk-125> If that's the extent of it, then why does the conversation quickly turn to the impact -- both real and perceived -- that immigrants have on American culture through everything from <unk-157> trucks to <unk-160> <unk-161> That seems to be the issue in North Dakota, where, according to a recent article in USA Today, towns facing tough economic times are <unk-186> resisting a cultural <unk-190> that could save them. In <unk-196> the locals opposed efforts to bring in a <unk-205> plant and a <unk-209> because those kind of dirty and hard jobs are likely to attract ... guess <unk-224> American kids who work at <unk-230> <unk-231> The article quotes <unk-235> <unk-236> a local community leader in <unk-196> who says that some residents have told him <unk-251> to <unk-253> that such facilities might attract Hispanic immigrants who could change the local culture. You'll find the same fear in <unk-273> <unk-274> Not long ago, an employee at a local library came up with the radical idea of a <unk-292> story time where children could hear tales read to them in <unk-304> <unk-305> wanted no part of that. They demanded that all books purchased by the <unk-319> or even <unk-322> be in <unk-325> These stories are <unk-329> but they're also <unk-333> They illustrate what some people are really concerned about with immigration, and it goes well beyond words like <unk-352> or <unk-354> It's the perception that the country is becoming more <unk-364> that Spanish is replacing English, that Hispanic immigrants are <unk-374> American identity, and that Main Street is turning into Little Mexico. A leader of the <unk-390> <unk-391> movement <unk-393> called it the <unk-397> of the United States. This sort of rhetoric is all about fear -- that those who thrive in the dominant culture are losing their <unk-422> that the mainstream is being <unk-428> by <unk-430> and that our children are going to live in a world where they're going to have to work a lot harder to keep up. It <unk-456> up the alarm bells that Benjamin Franklin set off about German immigrants in the late 18th century, who he insisted could never adopt the culture of the English, but would <unk-487> into our <unk-490> and by <unk-493> together establish their <unk-497> and <unk-499> to the <unk-502> of <unk-504> It popped up in the <unk-510> century amid worries that Chinese immigrants were <unk-518> which led to Congress <unk-523> the <unk-525> Chinese <unk-502> Act of <unk-530> And it helped welcome the 20th century when Massachusetts Sen. Henry <unk-542> Lodge warned that immigrants <unk-547> the <unk-549> were <unk-551> "the quality of <unk-555> <unk-556> and others complained that Italian immigrants were <unk-564> low <unk-566> <unk-567> to send all their money to their home country and prone to criminal activity.

S-81	<unk-0> China -- Championship leader Lewis Hamilton spun out of the Chinese Grand Prix to send the world title race to a <unk-22> finale in Brazil on October 21. A <unk-30> Lewis Hamilton leaves his car after spinning into the <unk-40> trap in <unk-43> <unk-44> Hamilton can still clinch the crown with third place in the closing race, but saw his <unk-61> lead cut to four by McLaren team-mate Fernando Alonso in <unk-43> The Spaniard finished second behind <unk-78> <unk-79> <unk-80> who also kept his title hopes alive by moving within seven points of <unk-94> The young Briton started the race in pole position and at one stage led <unk-109> by more than eight seconds as he again showed superb skills in the wet conditions. However, the 22-year-old stayed out on the <unk-132> track too long in his wet <unk-139> which deteriorated at an alarming rate to let <unk-148> <unk-109> take the lead. And when Hamilton -- who won in Japan last week to give himself the chance of <unk-169> the title this weekend -- finally headed toward the pit <unk-180> he spun out onto the <unk-40> to end his chances with 25 laps to go. <unk-109> and Alonso both switched to dry tires on the <unk-206> of the 56 <unk-210> with the Finn going on to win by by <unk-220> seconds for his fifth victory this season -- one more than both Hamilton and <unk-235> <unk-236> team-mate Felipe Massa was third, while fourth place was claimed by <unk-248> <unk-249> <unk-250> <unk-251> who was last week <unk-256> for causing an accident in Japan behind the safety car while Hamilton was cleared of any wrongdoing. Britain's Jenson Button was fifth in a Honda ahead of <unk-284> team-mate <unk-286> <unk-287> while Germany's Nick <unk-291> was seventh for BMW <unk-296> and David <unk-299> of Scotland took the final point for Red <unk-308> Hamilton was still confident he could bounce back after suffering his first retirement of the season. "I'm sorry for the team but I can still do it, don't <unk-337> he said. "When I got out of the car I was just <unk-350> because it was my first mistake all year, and to do it on the way into the <unk-368> was not something I usually do. "You cannot go through life without making mistakes. But I am over it and we look forward to Brazil. The team will be working hard to make sure the car is quick enough there, and we still have points in the bag. "We were having a great race and we didn't know if it was going to rain or not. The tyres were getting worse and worse and you could almost see the canvas <unk-449> When I came into the <unk-368> it was like ice, I couldn't do anything about it." McLaren boss Ron Dennis refused to blame his driver or his team for the <unk-480> "It's too extreme to say anyone made a mistake in this. It has been a very competitive season between our drivers and it will go on for another Grand <unk-510> Dennis said. "I don't think we did anything dramatically wrong and neither did <unk-524> But the circuit was considerably <unk-530> than the pit lane <unk-535> That's what made the difference. "It was easy to say that we could have stopped earlier, but would it have made a <unk-558> All the top teams -- Ferrari and ourselves -- were trying to get through the rain and straight onto a dry <unk-580> <unk-581> who qualified for the race in <unk-588> is seeking to become the third driver to win three world titles.

"I think the championship will still be very difficult because I know it will not be easy to take four points from <unk-524> "I need something dramatic if I want to win. With a normal race it will be <unk-656> <unk-109> added: "We are back in the championship and it will be interesting in the final race. <unk-674> the car is good and it will be a battle all weekend.

S-93	<unk-0> Colorado -- A Colorado man <unk-6> by threats after testifying against his daughter's abusive boyfriend says he has spent $10,000 on a security system, hired a <unk-27> for his son's wedding and never leaves home without a <unk-38> handgun strapped to his chest. Keith Reynolds was convicted for witness intimidation after threatening witnesses in his domestic assault case. The man, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the case, says the state did nothing to protect him after the 1999 conviction of Keith Reynolds for domestic abuse -- even after prosecutors told him a hit had been put on his family. A report in the Denver Post pointed out major problems protecting witnesses in the state of Colorado. Paul <unk-124> chairman of National District <unk-129> Association, told Congress this year that witness intimidation has become <unk-140> <unk-141> according to the Denver Post. When asked if prosecutors had made the family aware of <unk-157> witness protection program, the witness in the Reynolds case said, "All they told us was maybe we should <unk-176> "I'm pretty sure I told one of them -- either him or his wife -- about the program. I can't remember if I gave them all the <unk-204> the prosecutor assigned to the case, who didn't want to be named, told CNN. After <unk-220> conviction, the witness and his wife saw strange cars parked outside their home. They received phone calls during which the only sound on the other end of the line was a gun being <unk-254> The couple received a death threat from Reynolds himself through the <unk-266> Watch witness describe fear of being targeted » . Reynolds was then sentenced to ten years in a maximum security prison for witness <unk-290> However, it is likely he'll be released within five years. No national statistics on crimes against witnesses <unk-308> and minimal research has been conducted on the <unk-317> The latest National Institute of Justice survey on record -- conducted more than a decade ago -- shows that more than half of big city prosecutors consider witness intimidation a major problem. Colorado has $50,000 allocated to its witness protection budget. In contrast, the city of Denver spent almost $100,000 on <unk-369> last year. The state, on average, spends about $1,000 per <unk-380> That figure supposedly includes moving <unk-386> <unk-387> and <unk-389> The federal program spends in excess of $40 million per year on witness protection. One possible reason for the <unk-409> is that witnesses in state cases do not get new <unk-420> as do federal witnesses. "It's not designed to be a long-term <unk-432> at the public's <unk-436> it's a way to ensure the immediate safety of the <unk-447> according to Peter <unk-451> executive director of the Colorado Department of Public <unk-460> <unk-157> witness protection program is a <unk-467> according to The Rev.

He had plans to move east when a Fourth of July barbecue in 2004 in changed all that. He witnessed the murder of his best friend and subsequently testified against three men suspected in the killing. <unk-567> <unk-552> and his fiancee were gunned down while driving along a suburban street in <unk-630> Colorado. The couple, both 22, died <unk-637> <unk-551> <unk-552> says her son was never told about a witness protection program. She confronted prosecutors after his murder. <unk-552> told CNN, "I asked them what happened.

Prosecutors filed an order for protection requesting <unk-567> <unk-737> personal information be kept <unk-742> but it wasn't signed by a judge until one year later, after defense lawyers had already given the suspects <unk-737> personal information, along with crucial trial documents.

S-95	WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The White House is <unk-7> Congressional Democrats for not sending a bill that would fund <unk-18> care programs to the president's desk by Veterans Day. The White House's Dana <unk-32> accused Democrats of holding veterans care funding <unk-40> "There's absolutely no reason that the <unk-18> bill could not have been signed by the president today, except for the political games that the Democrats decided to play with it," White House press secretary Dana <unk-32> said Sunday in <unk-80> Texas. Congressional Democrats had attached legislation funding veterans programs to a <unk-92> billion bill that also funded a number of domestic <unk-102> including health, labor and education. Democrats also added <unk-111> billion to what the president <unk-117> for veterans programs. The <unk-122> bill would increase funding by more than $10 billion over last year's funding for those programs. The president has threatened to veto the bill because of the added spending. The House passed a <unk-156> bill <unk-158> last week with the veterans funding <unk-165> but the Senate later voted to strip out the veterans funding and send the <unk-156> bill to the president. <unk-32> accused the Democrats of <unk-190> to hold hostage our veterans to extra domestic spending or increases in <unk-203> "The president wants clean legislation, a clean bill to fund the <unk-215> <unk-32> said. On Saturday, the Democratic congressional leadership sent a letter to President Bush saying they welcomed a dialogue on spending, <unk-237> <unk-238> over funding levels <unk-242> never been so great that we cannot reach agreement on a spending plan that meets the needs of the American people." <unk-264> to this <unk-267> however, is some willingness on your part to actually find common <unk-279> House Speaker Nancy <unk-283> <unk-284> and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, <unk-291> said in the letter. The leadership said last year's Congress, which was still under Republican control, had never passed a separate bill funding veterans programs. Congress also sent to the president legislation that would fund veterans care at the levels requested by the president through December 14, the leadership said. The current funding level "is still below the <unk-350> billion extra that we <unk-355> said <unk-357> <unk-358> spokesman <unk-360> "We are committed to getting the extra funding that the Congress already voted on the president's desk for his <unk-380> The leadership blamed Republican members of Congress for <unk-389> the funding for the veterans programs by blocking its inclusion in the larger spending bill. <unk-405> though, said the Democrats could still send a separate bill to the president funding the veterans program that passed both chambers of Congress. "The Democrats decided not to send the president this <unk-438> <unk-32> said. "That has to be laid at their <unk-448> E-mail to a friend . CNN's <unk-455> Walsh contributed to this report.

S-96	WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Republicans reacted with surprise and <unk-8> Sunday to blistering criticism of the Iraq war from former coalition commander retired Lt. Gen. Ricardo <unk-25> <unk-26> lashed back at retired Gen. Ricardo Sanchez on Sunday after he criticized the war effort. On Friday, Sanchez, who was coalition commander in 2003 and 2004, called the Iraq war "a nightmare with no end in <unk-63> He said the Bush administration, the State Department and Congress all share blame. Speaking with military reporters in Virginia, Sanchez also said such <unk-87> of duty by a military officer would mean immediate dismissal or court <unk-100> but the politicians have not been held <unk-108> "I'm <unk-110> <unk-111> South Carolina Republican Sen.

That brought a <unk-299> response from McCain, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee. "I wish that he had given us the benefit of that knowledge at the time," McCain told <unk-329> <unk-330> the <unk-332> He said Sanchez should have spoken out at the time -- or resigned -- but <unk-348> that doesn't happen very <unk-353> One of the reasons few speak out, he said, is <unk-364> by what happened to former Army Chief of Staff Gen. Eric <unk-376> McCain said. <unk-379> was sidelined after telling Congress that hundreds of thousands of troops would be needed to occupy Iraq. Sen. Mitch <unk-399> a Republican from Kentucky, told ABC's "This <unk-407> that Sanchez is simply wrong. "My definition of winning is a stable country and an ally in the war on <unk-428> he said.

S-98	<unk-0> Iraq (CNN) -- None of the <unk-7> Iraqi detainees freed in recent weeks have broken a pledge not to return to the <unk-23> according to the Marine general who oversees the U.S. detention centers in Iraq. A U.S. military panel reviews a <unk-43> case at Camp <unk-47> near Baghdad. Speaking in <unk-52> Maj. Gen.

S-99	LONDON, England (CNN) -- Previously <unk-5> footage of Diana, Princess of Wales, taken just hours before she was killed in a car crash, has been shown to the jury at the inquest into her death. The footage showed Diana and <unk-40> step into an elevator at the <unk-47> <unk-48> Images taken from a security camera at the <unk-47> Hotel in Paris show the 36-year-old smiling as she and her lover <unk-40> <unk-71> step into an elevator and later walk out of the hotel. Further footage shows <unk-71> visiting a <unk-89> shop, images that could lend support to claims that he was buying an engagement ring. Earlier, a British coroner at the inquest said <unk-113> may never be known for certain whether Princess Diana was pregnant when she died in the Paris car crash. Lord Justice Scott Baker told the jury at the inquest into the deaths of the princess and her lover <unk-40> <unk-71> that scientific evidence might be unable to demonstrate "one way or the <unk-166> whether she was in the early stages of pregnancy. But he said they would hear <unk-182> details of her personal life. Watch footage of <unk-191> last hours » . Baker told the 11 members of the jury -- six women and five men -- Diana may have been on the <unk-217> pill and that evidence she was poised to get engaged to <unk-40> on the night she died was <unk-236> On Tuesday the judge, who is acting as coroner in the case, told the jury that a famous image taken in summer 1997 showing Diana wearing a <unk-264> could not be proof she was pregnant with <unk-273> child as she had not started a relationship with him at that stage. The jury is set to hear <unk-293> <unk-294> evidence, including CCTV and a tourist video. The inquest to establish cause of death is expected to be a six-month process. <unk-316> father, Mohammed Al <unk-320> has <unk-322> from the start that Diana and his son were murdered because the royal family <unk-337> not accept that an Egyptian Muslim could eventually be <unk-347> to the future king of <unk-353> referring to <unk-191> son Prince <unk-359> "I'm hoping for <unk-363> Al <unk-71> said outside court. "At last, we're going to have a jury from ordinary people and I hope to reach the decision which I believe that my son and Princess Diana have been murdered by the royal family." Baker told the jury of Al <unk-316> allegations, but again reminded them that they were responsible for deciding the facts of the case, but not to <unk-429> blame or <unk-432> "You have to decide four important, but limited <unk-441> <unk-442> who the deceased were, when they came by their deaths, where they came by their deaths and how they came by their <unk-465> Baker said, according to inquest <unk-471> "The first three questions are unlikely to give rise to any <unk-483> The fourth is a rather wider question and is directed towards the means by which they <unk-500> Diana, 36, and 42-year-old <unk-40> <unk-71> were killed on August 31, 1997 when the <unk-515> they were traveling in hit a <unk-522> in the <unk-525> de <unk-527> tunnel in Paris.
