it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s that pyramid .

it had two-@@ to-@@ three-@@ to-@@ 400 times the toxic loads ever allowed by the epa .
often what j@@ ams us up is sewage .
what do you do when you have this sort of disrupted flow ?
stephen pal@@ um@@ bi : following the mercury trail
i really thought they were so beneath me .
but we didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t realize at the time that we actually needed a third manipul@@ ator , because we couldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t manipulate the neck from inside and walk the horse at the same time .
and now we would like to introduce you to joey .
b@@ j : and mi@@ key also has , in his fingers , the ability to move the tail from left to right , and up and down with the other hand .
mi@@ key brett , craig , leo , z@@ em joaquin and basil and me .
in winter , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a lot of sleeping going on ; you enjoy your family life inside .
the thing to watch for as a global philanthropy industry comes about -- and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s exactly what is happening -- is how the aspiration is to flip these old assumptions , for philanthropy to become open and big and fast and connected , in service of the long term .
now , all of these big things for love -- experiments -- aren &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t going to take off .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to look quickly at the fourth and fifth categories , which are innovation , competitions and social investing .
it may be that the social sin@@ gul@@ arity ahead is the one that we fear the most : a conver@@ gence of catastro@@ ph@@ es , of environmental degradation , of weapons of mass destruction , of pandemi@@ cs , of poverty .
i believe that there are new , hidden tensions that are actually happening between people and institutions -- institutions that are the institutions that people inhab@@ it in their daily life : schools , hospitals , workplaces , factories , offices , etc .
the first gentleman , he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a baker .
so , think of the three settings i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve talked to you about : factory , migration , office .
they were living on top of the workshops where they were working .
so , how many of you have ever gotten behind the wheel of a car when you really shouldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t have been driving ?
one of the things that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve developed in the lab -- we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve developed several vehicles -- is what we believe is the world &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s first autonom@@ ously drifting car .
now , clearly we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re not going to put a couple of electro@@ des on his head and understand exactly what all of his thoughts are on the track .
watch the mental workload , and watch the steering .
so today , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to tell you about some people who didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t move out of their neighborhoods .
so a few years ago , l.a. county decided that they needed to spend 2.5 billion dollars to repair the city schools .
i mean , literally , her hometown is called whit@@ es@@ ville , west virginia .
so these three guys all understand how to produ@@ ctively channel dollars through our local economies to meet existing market demands , reduce the social problems that we have now and prevent new problems in the future .
our municipalities , rural and urban , play the operational course of infrastructure -- things like waste disposal , energy demand , as well as social costs of unemployment , drop-@@ out rates , incarceration rates and the impacts of various public health costs .
and reading that book made me re@@ examine that theory because i need to explain what i mean by that .
and i think because early on , frankly , my programs were just a little bit ahead of their time .
and my question is , how did we get from there to here ?
i went to deaf clubs .
and yet , we have nobody who is trying to ensure that the next generation of children born to african-@@ americans and asi@@ ans come out with creamy skin and yellow hair .
and he ended up achieving at a level that had never before been contemplat@@ ed by any member of his family .
the experience of down syndrome people includes those who are actors , those who are writers , some who are able to live fully independently in adulthood .
and a lot of the time the question of parenthood is , what do we vali@@ date in our children , and what do we cure in them ?
and ultimately i feel that in the same way that we test fla@@ me-@@ re@@ tar@@ dant pa@@ jamas in an infer@@ no to ensure they won &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t catch fire when our child reaches across the stove , so these stories of families negotiating these extreme differences reflect on the universal experience of parenting , which is always that sometimes you look at your child and you think , where did you come from ?
and he had a very large head , which she thought might indicate hydro@@ cep@@ hal@@ us .
and i came from a very privileged background . i was very lucky .
never shown this picture before , and probably going to be sued for it .
the point being , this is going to be very , very intensive on the programming side .
you want a separate thing , like the ac adap@@ tor .
if you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re in a desert , they can talk to each other about two kilometers apart .
not something you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d envy or want to do .
and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not to go out and buy 100 or 1,000 , though , i invite you to do that , and 10,000 would be even better .
and there are days -- i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t know about the rest of you guys -- but there are days when i pal@@ p@@ ably feel how much i rely on other people for pretty much everything in my life .
so actually now on this website , we have 18,000 people .
and we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re building upon innovations of generations who went before us .
but remember , greece is there today .
and when you think about the economy through these two different lenses , you understand why this crisis is so hard to solve , because the worse the crisis gets , the higher the stakes are , the more each side thinks they know the answer and the other side is just going to ruin everything .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s 20 percent of the budget , and that presents a more difficult issue .
the phrase that you want , if you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re a graduate student or a post@@ doc or you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re a professor , a 38-year-old economics professor , is , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m an empi@@ ri@@ cist .
we know what it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s like to have these people on tv , in congress , yelling about how the end of the world is coming if we don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t adopt their view completely , because it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s happened about the dollar ever since there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s been a dollar .
and he said to the guy , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; why have you put stuff on the back that no one will ever see ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
i thought , well that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not good enough .
the wir@@ ing from your sensory apparatus to those bits is shorter than the bits that have to pass through the thin@@ ky bit , the corte@@ x .
where are you feeling this ?
and also triumph , this sense of tran@@ scen@@ dence , this &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; i never knew that . ah , this is something new . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
so i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to sham@@ elessly expose something to you , which is beautiful to me .
and then i can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t tell you how hard it is to do that radi@@ ator , which is curved .
no one &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s going to notice those split lines and changes .
but what i have to do now , feeling again , what i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got to do is to be able to supply enough of these enzy@@ mes , of these triggers into something early on in the process , that you pick it up , not through your thinking , but through your feeling .
no time . it says i have two minutes left , so we can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t do this .
now i think it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s too easy .
we have se@@ cul@@ ari@@ zed badly , i would argue .
we need data , we don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t need help .
you need to keep repeating the lesson 10 times a day .
this comes across also in the way in which religions set up rituals around important feelings .
and when they teach us a lesson , they do it via the body .
but that feeling of puzz@@ lement is structural to contemporary art .
the people in the modern world , in the secular world , who are interested in matters of the spirit , in matters of the mind , in higher sou@@ l-@@ like concerns , tend to be isolated individuals .
if you want to change the world , you have to group together , you have to be collaborative .
and i say , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; of course . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; and they say , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; so aren &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t you sort of religious ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
because you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve agreed on 90 percent of things , because you have a shared view on so many things , and you politely differ .
so it took me from places like chile -- the at@@ ac@@ ama desert in chile -- to si@@ beria , to underground mines in the japanese alps , in northern america , all the way to antarctica and even to the south pole .
you need something like tens of me@@ gat@@ ons of water -- almost a gi@@ gat@@ on of water -- in order to have any chance of catching this neut@@ rin@@ o .
the toilets there are literally holes in the ground covered with a wooden sh@@ ack .
so this is us landing on the ross ice shelf in antarctica .
the fabric alone weighs two tons .
anil an@@ anth@@ as@@ w@@ amy : what it takes to do extreme astro@@ physics
well , first you have to , as an engineer , scope the problem . how big is it ?
and a book@@ mobile -- the size of a van with a satellite dish , a prin@@ ter , binder and cut@@ ter , and kids make their own books .
we have one of these things now . it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s completely cool .
but we sent -- thought , ok , if we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to need to do this , let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s do it in-@@ library .
the getty here is moving their books to the ucla , which is where we have one these scanning centers , and scanning their out-of-@@ copyright books , which is fabulous .
it costs about 10 dollars a piece to go and take a dis@@ k and put it online , if you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re doing things in volume .
we tended towards longer-term things and also things that people can re@@ use and make into new movies , which has just been great fun .
so anyway , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got basically an idea of where things came from .
so en@@ vision what it looks like all wrapped up .
it looked more like this when it was all wrapped up -- not quite so pretty .
and frankly , i face a big obstacle .
but these are essentially ex@@ tern@@ alized stom@@ ach@@ s and lungs .
so , fung@@ i and my@@ ce@@ li@@ um se@@ que@@ ster carbon dioxide in the form of calcium ox@@ al@@ ates .
the my@@ ce@@ li@@ um , in the right conditions , produces a mushroom -- it bursts through with such fero@@ city that it can break asphalt .
and i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll show you a graph here .
there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a ve@@ tted press release that you can read -- it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s ve@@ tted by do@@ d -- if you google &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; stam@@ ets &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; and &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; smallpox . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
so , the house is no longer suitable for invasion .
too many withdrawals from the carbon bank , and so this population will be shut down .
so we had our own miniature rainforest , a private beach with a coral reef .
so eight of us went in : four men and four women .
we stopped irri@@ g@@ ating our soil , as much as we could .
but on the other hand , it was the scientific gold of the project , because we could really cran@@ k this baby up , as a scientific tool , and see if we could , in fact , find where those seven tons of oxygen had gone .
i had been growing all my own food .
and all of it was coming from this : shrimp farms .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s such a huge subject . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and if you lose where you are in your bio@@ sphere , or are perhaps having a difficulty connecting with where you are in the bio@@ sphere , i would say to you , take a deep breath .
the cause of our troubles is actually the complexity that science has given us .
we have now found treatments for nearly all of the tens of thousands of conditions that a human being can have .
there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s another sign that we need pit crews , and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the un@@ manageable cost of our care .
skill number one is the ability to recognize success and the ability to recognize failure .
we got the lead safety engineer for boeing to help us .
there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a deep resistance because using these tools forces us to confront that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re not a system , forces us to behave with a different set of values .
and most of those losses are because of things we know .
if you don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t just want a queen , you can buy , actually , a three-@@ pound package of bees , which comes in the mail , and of course , the postal office is always very concerned when they get , you know , your three-@@ pound packages of bees .
but if you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re losing 50 percent to 80 percent of your colonies , you can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t survive three years in a row . and we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re really worried about losing this segment of our industry .
and bees are very faithful .
and of course , bees are not the only important factor here .
but i also want to reinforce some of the ideas we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve heard here , because having a mead@@ ow or living by a mead@@ ow is transform@@ ational .
well actually , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve &@@ #@@ 9@@ 1@@ ; been &@@ #@@ 93@@ ; whist@@ ling since the age of four , about four .
i lost my face .
and i want to first rehear@@ se with you your whist@@ ling .
some of them are very easy .
and they also are able to show and to exhibit such a wonderful and complex behavior that can be described just with the term of intelligence .
look at this young bean that is moving to catch the light every time .
how is it possible to do this without a brain ?
and why are they so similar ?
thank you .
they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to be entering this car one by one .
and also in 50 other cities around the world , people participated .
and because it was in union square park , right by a subway station , there were hundreds of people by the end who stopped and looked up and watched what we were doing .
they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re wearing either a yellow shirt or a black shirt .
he gave 2,000 high fi@@ ves that day , and he washed his hands before and afterward and did not get sick .
and not knowing where help was needed always ensured that help was in short supply in the areas that needed it most .
our goal over the next year is to get water canary ready for the field and to open-@@ source the hardware so that anyone can contribute to the development and the evaluation , so we can tackle this problem together .
now why am i talking about cows ?
so what i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m proposing is , just as we require reading , writing , ari@@ th@@ me@@ tic , american history , so we should have a curriculum on facts about all the religions of the world -- about their history , about their cre@@ eds , about their texts , their music , their symboli@@ sms , their prohib@@ itions , their requirements .
all i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m saying is -- facts . facts only .
except , of course , it wasn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t the sheep &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s clever@@ ness .
the lesson we learn from this is you don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t have to have a mind to be a beneficiary .
and how can we do that ?
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m talking also about christianity .
yes .
but i wish it were better .
and here i think , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; wait a minute . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
well , this from &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; the purpose driven life &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; -- &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; the bible must become the authorit@@ ative standard for my life , the compass i rely on for direction , the counsel i listen to for making wise decisions and the benchmark i use for evaluating everything . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
now do we really want to commit ourselves to engul@@ fing all the other religions when their holy books are telling them , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t listen to the other side , that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s just sat@@ an talking ! &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
ears are made not for hearing , but for listening .
it looks a bit like this .
if you can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t hear somebody talking to you in a loud voice , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s too loud .
first of all , listen consciously .
and my relationship to especially human-@@ made objects which someone else said they work like this , well , i can say they work a different way , a little bit .
so kids don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t have as hard of a time with this , and i saw in my own son , i gave him this book .
and then you can take the little piano circuit off the pencil .
and so we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re like , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; we gotta put a video out about this . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
okay , just wait for this one . this is good .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s really going to be seven billion pairs of hands , each following their own pas@@ sions , and each kind of like a mosa@@ ic coming up and creating this world in their backy@@ ards and in their kitchens .
but they won &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t come to us directly through light .
but einstein always thought black holes were a mathemati@@ cal od@@ dity .
it would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there because we couldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t , anymore than light can escape .
this is from my group -- a slightly less glamorous computer modeling .
and surely , somewhere in the universe two black holes have merged .
galaxies form , and generations of stars form in those galaxies , and around one star , at least one star , is a hab@@ itable planet .
so we have to wonder , if there is a multiverse , in some other patch of that multiverse , are there creatures ?
of the 100 incarcerated people that are released , 60 will return to prison .
well , it has its plu@@ ses and min@@ uses .

now comes the green movement -- the summer of 2009 , as my film is released -- the uprising begins in the streets of tehran .
it can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t afford to doubt the person who tends the child .

i will come to it later .
you cannot command compassion unless you become limit@@ less , and nobody can become limit@@ less , either you are or you are not . period .
you act com@@ passion@@ ately .
if this does not blow your mind , then you have no emotion .
and let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s pause here .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s good for motivated students .
in a traditional classroom , you have a couple of homework , homework , lecture , homework , lecture , and then you have a snapshot exam .
and you can go to the site right now . it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s all free . not trying to sell anything .
red means they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re stuck .
and we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re seeing it over and over and over again .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m still doing all the videos , but we have a rockstar team doing the software .
and they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re literally saying , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; hey , this is nice , but ... &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; like that focus graph , a lot of the teachers said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; i have a feeling that a lot of the kids are jumping around and not focusing on one topic . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
but there are also hallu@@ cin@@ ations as well , and hallu@@ cin@@ ations are completely different .
i see a lot of children . they are walking up and down stairs .
i said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; there is a special form of visual hallu@@ cin@@ ation which may go with deteriorating vision or blin@@ dness .
the first thing he said was he saw a hand@@ ker@@ chief in mi@@ da@@ ir .
and he turned around . and then he divided into six figures in striped shirts , who started walking towards her .
but no more than one percent of the people acknowledge them , because they are afraid they will be seen as insane or something .
when people have these simple geometri@@ cal hallu@@ cin@@ ations , the primary visual corte@@ x is activated .
it is only if one is visually impaired or blind that the process is interrupted .
and actually i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m a little visually impaired myself .
but i would come back from those dives and try to share the experience with words , and they were totally inadequate to the task .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s unbelievable .
this looks like something out of a dr. seu@@ ss book -- just all manner of creatures all over this thing .
and we view it with a camera system i developed called eye@@ -in-@@ the-@@ sea that uses far red light that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s invisible to most animals , so it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive .
and it does actually seem to be trying to eat the electronic j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish .

humanity is now fully into the tech@@ no-@@ scientific age .
during 41 years of teaching biology at harvard , i watched sadly as bright students turned away from the possibility of a scientific career or even from taking non-@@ required courses in science because they were afraid of failure .
judge opportunity by how few other students and researchers are on hand .
or larger , what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the role of dark matter in the expansion of the universe ?
humans have lived for much , much longer than the approximately 10,000 years of settled agricultural civilization in small family groups . nom@@ adi@@ c hunters bring down rabb@@ its , gathering food .
more recently , that power is un@@ te@@ thering and leap@@ ing off the desk@@ tops , and very , very quickly , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to see a significant proportion , if not the majority of the human race , walking around holding , carrying or wearing super@@ computers linked at speeds greater than what we consider to be broadband today .

what happened ?
i said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; how many of you now go home earlier than you used to ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
so you take a piece , you just put it on the side .
the next part i want to show you is something about the positive motivation .
you had to measure the milk and add it , mixing it .
at the top of the sheet , we had little di@@ agra@@ ms of how do you fold orig@@ ami .
by the way , these are my kids , which , of course , are wonderful and so on .

this is a picture of what pur@@ sat looks like .
but for us it meant freedom .
one day a man told me , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; my future does not look brilliant , but i want to have a brilliant future for my son . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
so the key here is empathy .
we revised the mental health component of the primary health care services by adding psycho@@ -@@ social care and psycho@@ -@@ social counsel@@ ors to the system .
when jun@@ gian analyst inge miss@@ mah@@ l visited afghanistan , she saw the inner wounds of war -- widespread despair , trauma and depression . and yet , in this county of 30 million people , there were only two dozen psychiatri@@ sts . miss@@ mah@@ l talks about her work helping to build the country &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s system of psycho@@ social counseling , promoting both individual and , perhaps , national healing .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s true of european bio@@ fuels .
top left , we have canada and australia , with enormous land areas , very high per capita consumption , 200 or 300 light bulbs per person , and very low population den@@ si@@ ties .
wind power produces a bit more , 2.5 watts per square meter , but that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s only twice as big as 1.25 watts per square meter , so that means if you wanted literally to produce total energy consumption in all forms on average from wind farms , you need wind farms half the area of the u.@@ k .
but the same goes for renewables as well .
next , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the heating lever .
so , if you wanted to get 16 light bulbs , remember , today our total energy consumption is 125 light bulbs &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; worth .
he mentioned four great world orchestr@@ as , and the fifth one was venezuela &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s youth symphony orchestra .

from the minute a child &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s taught how to play an instrument , he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s no longer poor .
think about it , all right ? i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to answer the phone three different times .
behavioral markers matter .
that actually occurred this year . she took early retirement .
we are obsessed with this way of thinking .
classic . hip fracture often leads to institution@@ alization of a senior .
these discoveries of behavioral markers , and behavioral changes are game changing , and like the discovery of the micro@@ scope because of our collecting data streams that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve actually never done before .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s achie@@ vable . we should do it economically , we should do it morally , and we should do it for quality of life .
we will see 30,000 new infected websites .
this is the market leader in malware distribution , the black hole exploit pack , responsible for nearly one third of malware distribution in the last couple of quarters .
so this is writing out the malicious code , and a few seconds later , on the left-@@ hand side , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll see the attacker &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s screen get some interesting new text .
what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s really insulting about this is not only does it provide the attackers with access to your data , but when the scan finishes , they tell you in order to clean up the fake viruses , you have to register the product .
a little more searching , and here &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s our cyber@@ criminal .
okay ? so you can see a list of wireless networks .
you see , technology &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s changing at a staggering rate , and that 250,000 pieces of malware won &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t stay the same for long .
i wasn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t very good at reading things .
you all know the story , right .
and that was really cool .
it was extraordinary .
&@@ quo@@ t@@ ; you can call it a dinosaur , but look at the vel@@ oci@@ rap@@ tor : the vel@@ oci@@ rap@@ tor is cool . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and they obviously make a lot of money off of them .
and so he agreed .
and quite frankly , i think if colonel sanders was to be careful how he wor@@ ded it , he could actually adverti@@ se an extra piece .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s based on diet intake surveys , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s based on levels of obesity , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s based on a range of factors that gives you an approxim@@ ate guess as to how much food is actually going into people &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s mouths .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s in fields around the world every single year .
go one step up , and you get to farmers , who throw away sometimes a third or even more of their harvest because of cosmetic standards .
the one in the middle , on my kitchen table . not much difference .
western countries throw out nearly half of their food , not because it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s ine@@ di@@ ble -- but because it doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t look appealing . tri@@ stra@@ m stuart del@@ ves into the shocking data of wasted food , calling for a more responsible use of global resources .
and this is all done , by the way , by the international astronomical union .
now , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to be going to mars one day . and when we do , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s going to be unfair for the people that are living there to have to live with these ridiculous names .

it just seems like it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not sexy and elegant , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s hidden .
thank you .
it was incredibly successful .
it thought of itself as being disconnected from the internet , but it was possible for somebody to smu@@ ggle a usb drive in there , or something like that , and software got in there that causes the centri@@ fu@@ ges , in that case , to actually destroy themselves .
and so if you hear an expert talking about the internet and saying it can do this , or it does do this , or it will do that , you should treat it with the same skepticism that you might treat the comments of an economist about the economy or a weather@@ man about the weather , or something like that .
good afternoon .
so military technologies can influence the course of the world , can make or break world peace -- and there lies the issue with cyber weapons .
today we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re moving to a multi@@ polar world in which coordination is much more complicated , as we have seen at copenhagen .
before that day , this is how i saw the ocean .
speaking of dinosaurs , sharks are basically the same fish they were 300 million years ago .
of course , sea cucum@@ bers shoot them out their re@@ ars , which , in my opinion , makes them much more interesting a superhero .
and he does manage to find them , but great navigation skills , l@@ ousy pick-up lines .
i couldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t fit them in .
sherman &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s up in shark heaven .
and you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re getting all kinds of cool stuff .
in the lower 48 , the far@@ the@@ st you can get away from a maintained road is 20 miles .
the tah@@ l@@ tan have called for the creation of a tribal heritage reserve which will set aside the largest protected area in british columbia .
multi@@ ply 22 times 47 , make sure you get 1,0@@ 34 , or the calcul@@ ators are not working . do all of you get 1,0@@ 34 ? 1,0@@ 34 ?
5@@ 29 .
7@@ 22 is 500 -- o@@ oh , that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a harder one .
in the meanwhile , let me conclude the first part of my show by doing something a little trick@@ ier .
ok , any six of them .
audience : february .
what year , chris , would you like ?
audience : six . six .
now , 57 times 68 is 3,@@ 400 , plus 4@@ 76 is 38@@ 76 , that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s 38,@@ 7@@ 60 plus 171 , 38,@@ 7@@ 60 plus 171 is 38,@@ 9@@ 31 .
a third time , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s just being a technician .
change is happening , and the change that is happening is not one that is in software .
had collected photographs of me , as mothers will do .
and i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll just say what i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m about to do . what i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m about to do -- i hope you can recognize that there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a distorted sine wave , almost a tri@@ an@@ gular wave upon this he@@ w@@ le@@ tt-@@ pac@@ kar@@ d osc@@ il@@ lo@@ scope .
but you will need to know eigh@@ th-@@ grade al@@ ge@@ bra , and we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to do serious experiments .
now , so i know the frequency .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going home for a midterm . a riot &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s going on on campus .
i pop up the top , and there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a cu@@ pol@@ a .
well i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m here to suggest there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a better way , that less might actually equal more .
secondly , our new mantra : small is sexy .
maybe , just maybe , less might equal more .
that fixed behavior -- which is rigid and stereo@@ ty@@ ped and ends up with a meal -- changes .
if we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got them wired up with an electro@@ en@@ cep@@ hal@@ o@@ gram , the right brain of each of them becomes att@@ un@@ ed , so that the joyful emergence of this earliest of play scenes and the physi@@ ology of that is something we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re beginning to get a handle on .
this happens to be ok -- he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s an anat@@ omi@@ cally interested little boy and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s his mom . other situations wouldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t be quite so good .
they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d given me a large grant when i was an academi@@ cian for the study of felony drunken drivers , and i thought i had a pretty good track record , and by the time i had spent half an hour talking about play , it was obvious that they were not -- did not feel that play was serious .
and i think if you think about life without play -- no humor , no flir@@ tation , no movies , no games , no fantasy and , and , and .
found that when he looked at a playground out of a window into which he had been confined , he felt something different .
characterized by a feeling of energi@@ zed focus , full involvement and success in the process of the activity .
and its hugely important in learning and cra@@ fting the brain .
we decided to do something a little bit different and transform flavors that were very familiar -- so in this case , so we take a carrot cake , put it in a blender , and we have kind of like a carrot cake juice , and then that went into a balloon frozen in liquid nitrogen to create this hollow shell of carrot cake ice cream , i guess , and it comes off looking like , you know , jupiter &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s floating around your plate .
hc : so , after about a day of chris and i staring at each other , we came up with something that was pretty close to the hamburger patty , and as you can see it basically forms like hamburger meat .
hc : so this is where we step into the future and we leap@@ frog ahead .
so , why don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t we hear more about the world ?
where &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s art ? i got productivity . i got sports .
and one of them is called take@@ ta . which is which ?
the full videos are online if you are interested .
but if i come up really close and stare directly at the camera on this laptop then you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll see these nice crisp eyes .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d like to show you thing called sn@@ out , which is -- the idea behind this project is to make a robot that appears as if it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s continually surprised to see you .
if this virus was in thousands of individuals at this point , why was it the case that it took us until 1984 to be able to discover this virus ?
deep in a remote region of cameroon , two hunters stal@@ k their prey .
they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re also going to ask you the question that when we knew that this was the way that hiv entered into the human population , and that other diseases had the potential to enter like this , why did we let these behaviors continue ?
paul worked for years on the camer@@ o@@ onian national radio and television , and he spoke about health issues . he was a health correspondent .
and let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s face it , any new retro@@ virus in the human population -- it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s something we should be aware of .
and because of that announcement , we got a big article in the new york times , which led to more press , which led to more attention , and me deciding to become ceo of that company -- whereas i was just an adviser -- and raising a round of venture capital and ramping up hiring .
and they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re tweeting , in some cases , from behind closed-@@ door sessions with the president .
people have raised tens of thousands of dollars over twitter in a matter of days on several occasions .
my mother says that i started reading at the age of two , although i think four is probably close to the truth .
my mother was an administrator .
i must say that before i went to the u.s. i didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t consciously identify as african .
the political climate in the u.s. at the time was tense , and there were debates going on about immigration .
when i learned , some years ago , that writers were expected to have had really unhappy child@@ hoods to be successful , i began to think about how i could in@@ vent horrible things my parents had done to me .
now , the conventional wisdom was that nigerians don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t read literature .
she introduced them to a book about the southern life that they had left behind : &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; they sat around , reading the book themselves , listening to me read the book , and a kind of paradise was regained . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
it literally flat-@@ lined .
well for the sake of time , i want to focus on just three strategies .
we need to fundamentally re@@ define who it is that experts are .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m looking for a third way : i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m preparing to get alzheimer &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s disease .
would they give me charts and graph@@ s that i could color ?
al@@ anna sh@@ ai@@ kh : how i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m preparing to get alzheimer &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s
the network has two components in them .
the battery is not the gas tank , in a sense .
and these prices are actually with clean elec@@ tr@@ ons .
and i had to quit and come and do this thing called a better place .
as we star@@ ed scaling it up we looked at what is the problem to come up to the u.s. ?
we go back down . it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s going to go up and down .
now where is the car industry on that ?
now when we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re looking at solving big problems , we need to start thinking in two numbers .
we have to make the right moral decision .
they see us as rocking the boat , and you can understand why .
complexity is the problem that any theory of biology has to solve , and you can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t solve it by post@@ ul@@ ating an agent that is even more complex , thereby simply compo@@ unding the problem .
now , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a typical scientific journal , the quarterly review of biology .
and however we define a@@ thei@@ sm , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s surely the kind of academic belief that a person is entitled to hold without being vi@@ li@@ fied as an un@@ patriotic , un@@ elec@@ table non-@@ citizen .
in 1998 , larson and with@@ am polled the cream of american scientists , those who &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d been honored by election to the national academy of sciences , and among this select group , belief in a personal god dropped to a shat@@ tering seven percent .
darwin said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; i have never been an a@@ thei@@ st in the same sense of denying the existence of a god .
nonetheless , if we want to attract deep down a@@ thei@@ sts to come out publicly , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to have find something better to stick on our banner than &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; tooth fairy &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; or &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; te@@ apo@@ t ag@@ no@@ stic . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
we need an anti-@@ tem@@ ple@@ ton to step forward .
what this picture suggests to us is that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got a radical change in the way information production and exchange is capitali@@ zed . not that it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s become less capital intensive -- that there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s less money that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s required -- but that the ownership of this capital , the way the capitali@@ zation happens , is radically distributed . each of us , in these advanced economies , has one of these , or something rather like it -- a computer .
the critical innovation here is instead of our engineers , or our people saying which is the most relevant , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to go out and count what you , people out there on the web , for whatever reason -- vanity , pleasure -- produced links , and tied to each other . we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to count those , and count them up .
and if dinner isn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t entirely obvious , think of sex .
but -- and this is the dark lining -- it is threatened by -- in the same way that it threatens -- the incumbent industrial systems .
due to some sli@@ p-@@ ups , he managed to escape dressed as a woman and ran from london back to nigeria where , according to our constitution , those in office as governors , president -- as in many countries -- have immunity and cannot be prosecuted . but what happened : people were so outraged by this behavior that it was possible for his state legislature to impeach him and get him out of office .
we are grateful , but we know that we can take charge of our own dest@@ ini@@ es if we have the will to reform .
and in the three years that i was finance minister , they made an average of 360 million dollars profit per year .
and what is more important , because we want to get away from oil and diversify -- and there are so many opportunities in this one big country , as in many countries in africa -- what was remarkable is that much of this growth came not from the oil sector alone , but from non-@@ oil .
not all of them have been perfect , or will be , but the trend is very clear .
so , she &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll make a little pair of dung@@ are@@ es with cor@@ du@@ ro@@ ys , with african material mixed in . very creative designs , has reached a stage where she even had an order from wal@@ -@@ mart .
every year , 36@@ ,000 people in the united states die of seasonal flu .
this worked well for most pathogens , somewhat well for cra@@ fty bugs like flu , but not at all for hiv , for which humans have no natural immunity .
and also , what the antibodies use is a handle to essentially grab and neutr@@ alize the virus .
many thought that it was just impossible to make an aids vaccine , but today , evidence tells us otherwise .
in the longer term , what they can do is use these tools of retro@@ -@@ vaccin@@ ology to make a preventive flu vaccine .
luckily for us , we live in an era of breathtaking biome@@ dical advances .
india , mexico and others are already making experimental flu vaccines , and they may be the first place we see these vaccines in use .
sb : you know , everybody says it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s 10 years , but it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s been 10 years every 10 years .
and these are not really a people op@@ pressed by poverty .
i would also like to pay homage and honor to the ted fel@@ lows june ar@@ ung@@ a , james shi@@ k@@ wat@@ i , andrew , and the other ted fel@@ lows .
did you know that 40 percent of the wealth created in africa is not invested here in africa ?
i belong to an internet discussion forum , an african internet discussion forum , and i asked them , i said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; since 1960 , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve had exactly 204 african heads of state , since 1960 . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not wealth creation . it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s wealth re@@ distribution .
if you look into their traditional systems , africans organize their states in two types .
and when they produce their crops , they sell the surplus on market@@ places .
a bigger boat will mean more fish will be caught and landed .
and i was sure that it was going to be great for democracy and for our society .
scott &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s results were full of them .
and the challenge with these kinds of algorith@@ mic filters , these personalized filters , is that , because they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re mainly looking at what you click on first , it can throw off that balance .
we need it to introduce us to new ideas and new people and different perspectives .
she said &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; yes , that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s former vice president al gore and his wife ti@@ pper . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
just in the last two days , we got the new temperature records in january .
a lot of us in here have made that decision and it is really pretty easy .
help with the mass persua@@ sion campaign that will start this spring .
and all the burning of oil and coal and gas , all the fossil fuels , have changed the atmosphere greatly .
you go in along the shore , you can find it everywhere .
so this is the gulf of mexico , sparkling place full of fish .
but he told ted that on the last day he went out , a bottlen@@ ose dolphin suddenly appeared next to the boat , and it was splat@@ tering oil out its blo@@ whole .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re starting with something that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s had a lot of stresses and a lot of problems to begin with .
here are shrimp boats employed .
it turns out that -- you see this sign on almost every commercial vessel in the united states -- you know , if you spilled a couple of gallons of oil , you would be in big trouble .
there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s certainly a common theme about needing to make the moment out of this .
well i built a fusion reactor when i was 14 years old .
taylor wilson : y@@ up , i built a nuclear fusion reactor
everybody : i am my conne@@ c@@ tom@@ e .
you can recognize them instantly by their fantastic shapes .
we color every neur@@ on in , in a different color , and then we look through all of the images , find the syna@@ pses and note the colors of the two neurons involved in each syna@@ pse .
but may i ?
and there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a lot of evidence that ne@@ ural activity is en@@ coding our thoughts , feelings and perceptions , our mental experiences .
let us attempt to read out memories from conne@@ c@@ tom@@ es .
if you believe that i am my conne@@ c@@ tom@@ e , i think you must also accept the idea that death is the destruction of your conne@@ c@@ tom@@ e .
zach kaplan : keith and i lead a research team .
because the way that he presented the concept -- his approach was totally different than ours . he sold it to you as if it was for sale right now .
now , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m not going to get into the physics of it , but all you need to know is that the faster the magnet &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s falling , the greater the stopping force .
z@@ k : i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d just like to let you all know that this presentation has been brought to you by target .
while he was doing this , he noticed an unexpected thing .
packaging that changes color when your milk &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s gone off .
zach kaplan + keith schacht : toys and materials from the future
can we produce a menu that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s delicious without fo@@ ie gras ?
&@@ quo@@ t@@ ; spanish chef accused ... &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; -- and the french accused him .
he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s really just in love with -- he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s at one with -- he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the goose whisper@@ er .
even though they were imprisoned in this garden of eden with fi@@ gs and everything else .
his biggest obstacle , really , was the marketplace , which demands these days bright yellow fo@@ ie gras .
and he grabs my arm and the translator &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s , and ducks us under a bush and says , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; watch this . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
they don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t need anything more . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
but i can taste things .
i really was moved .
he tasted it and fell in love with it .
if human beings disappeared , life on earth as we know it would flourish . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
but now we need a new fire that makes us safe , secure , healthy and durable .
let me say that again .
america could lead this next automotive revolution .
we can use some smart it to enhance transit and enable car sharing and ride sharing .
most of it now is wasted and the technologies for saving it keep improving faster than we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re installing them .
well , from the coal burned at the power plant through all these compo@@ unding losses , only a tenth of the fuel energy actually ends up coming out the pipe as flow .
and when a big plant goes down , you lose a thousand mega@@ watts in milli@@ seconds , often for weeks or months , often without warning .
in 1976 , for example , government and industry insisted that the amount of energy needed to make a dollar of gdp could never go down .
thank you .
and third , the engagement in developing countries was with a narrow set of government elites with little interaction with the citizens , who are the ultimate beneficiaries of development assistance .
in this map from moldova , the green color shows those districts that have low spending on schools but good educational outcomes , and the red color shows the opposite .
we will find that these children , too , have a real chance of breaking their way out of poverty .
if we take the tooth@@ brush -- i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t think about the tooth@@ brush .
after , we become a fish ; after , we become a frog ; after , we become a monkey ; after , we become what we are today : a super-@@ monkey , and the fun is , the super-@@ monkey we are today , is at half of the story .
if you walk like that , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s ok , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s ok , you can walk , but perhaps , because you walk with the eyes like that , you will not see , oh , there is a hole .
if you look like that , you look to the past , or you look inside if you are very flexible , inside yourself .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s why we must adapt .
we can say to our children , ok , done , that was our story . that passed .
no sl@@ ou@@ ching , no pants hanging down , none of that stuff .
and the drill sergeant starts screaming at them , and telling them to do all kinds of awful things .
no , no , it begins the first time a child in a mother &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s arms looks up at the mother and says , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; oh , this must be my mother .
the last chapter in my book is called &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; the gift of a good start . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
give him to the army . we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll never see him again . we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll never see him again . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
you get a job and get out of the house .
&@@ quo@@ t@@ ; it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s okay , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s okay . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m a marke@@ ter , and as a marke@@ ter , i know that i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve never really been in control .
hulu and netflix , among other companies , have open vacation policies .
the days are past when a person , company or brand could tightly control their reputation -- online chatter and spin mean that if you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re relevant , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a constant , free-@@ form conversation happening about you that you have no control over . tim le@@ bere@@ cht offers three big ideas about accepting that loss of control , even designing for it -- and using it as an impetus to re@@ commit to your values .
they want to make people live in fear .
but people did not relate to this .
they were actually attacking them .
seriously , with the amount of change i had noticed in this square , i thought it was 12 years .
i feel that i have dignity that i have lost for so many years . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
so we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve been studying the babies using a technique that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re using all over the world and the sounds of all languages .
so babies absorb the statistics of the language and it changes their brains ; it changes them from the citizens of the world to the cul@@ tu@@ re-@@ bound listeners that we are .
whatever you put in front of them , they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll take statistics on .
in investigating the child &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s brain , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to uncover deep truths about what it means to be human , and in the process , we may be able to help keep our own minds open to learning for our entire lives .
but i have to tell you a funny story .
so what happened now is , when the water@@ color was flowing into the structure , the water@@ colors do not mix with the fer@@ ro@@ fluid .
i could do it again to show it one more time , but some would argue that this is a complete waste of the whiskey , and that i should rather drink it .
in that hospice , there were 31 men and women who were actively dying .
and my family brought in a woman whose mother had been a slave to take care of me .
and you know , we have a society , a world , that is paraly@@ zed by fear .
but it also takes a soft front -- the capacity to really be open to the world as it is , to have an un@@ defended heart .
may we actu@@ alize that capacity for women everywhere .
now , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s no surprise that when you add consecutive fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i numbers , you get the next fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i number . right ?
beneath that , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll put a two-@@ by-@@ two square , and next to that , a three-@@ by-@@ three square , beneath that , a five-@@ by-@@ five square , and then an eight-@@ by-@@ eight square , creating one giant rec@@ t@@ angle , right ?
now , being iran@@ ian-@@ american presents its own set of problems , as you know .
and i started fre@@ aking out , because i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t know what kind of crap my grandfather was into .
but what was interesting was , the pakistani muslim guy -- see he gives a bad name to muslims and middle ea@@ ster@@ ners and pakistan@@ is from all over the world .
he goes , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to the zara store . it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s three miles away .
i go , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s got to be my driver . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
marco tem@@ pest : when asked about deception , he said this : magic is the only honest profession .
where is the queen ?
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to show you how terrorism actually inter@@ acts with our daily life .
at the same time , while i was interviewing the red briga@@ des , i also discovered that their life was not ruled by politics or ideology , but actually was ruled by economics .
so , i decided that i wanted to investigate the economics of terrorism .
but the great change came , of course , with glob@@ alization and dere@@ gul@@ ation .
now , when i went to look at the figures of the u.s. money supply , the u.s. money supply is the amount of dollars that the federal reserve prints every year in order to satisfy which , of course , reflects the growth of the economy .
now , the euro was a newly born currency of great opportunity for business , and , of course , for investment .
this has given me a very special relationship with the ocean .
i wanted to live a life that i could be proud of .
i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t think i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve ever felt so happy in my entire life .
i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t see anybody for the whole time that i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m at sea , generally .
awful , really awful .
when they opened this one up , they found its stomach was full of plastic .
i even met one of them and she was just about my size .
and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s very difficult to be happy on a planet that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s racked with famine and drought .
so anyway , today we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll talk about architecture a little bit , within the subject of creation and optimism .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s too late . that is gone .
can i have the lights off for a moment ?
and so what the builder will get is every single individual part that has been custom manufactured off-@@ site and delivered on a truck to the site , to that builder , and a set of these instruction manu@@ als .
they were asked to design , replace that bridge in six weeks , building it , including all of the parts , manufactured .
rosa mexi@@ cano restaurant , where he tran@@ sports us to the shores of ac@@ apul@@ co , up on the upper west side , with this wall of cliff divers who -- there you go , like that .
take it from me . under the bed is not a good hiding spot .
see , they asked me what i wanted to be , then told me what not to be .
standing up for yourself doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t have to mean embracing violence .
so we grew up believing no one would ever fall in love with us , that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d be lonely forever , that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d never meet someone to make us feel like the sun was something they built for us in their tool@@ shed .
we were fre@@ aks -- lobster claw boys and bear@@ ded ladies , od@@ dities ju@@ ggling depression and loneliness , playing soli@@ ta@@ ire , spin the bottle , trying to kiss the wounded parts of ourselves and heal , but at night , while the others slept , we kept walking the tigh@@ trope .
the future states that there is no time other than the collap@@ sation of that sensation of the mirror of the memories in which we are living .
so , as i say before the last piece , feel not as though it is a sphere we live on , rather an infinite plane which has the illusion of leading yourself back to the point of origin .
in ontario , the bore@@ al marches down south to the north shore of lake superior .
now , you can apply that same kind of thinking here as well .
and the tail@@ ings pon@@ ds range in size up to 9,000 acres .
this is one of the reasons why canada , originally a climate change hero -- we were one of the first signat@@ ories of the kyo@@ to accord .

he creates these opul@@ ent table@@ aus inspired by hier@@ ony@@ mus bosch , but also by the kash@@ mi@@ ri tex@@ tiles of his youth .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m an ecolo@@ gist , and i study complexity . i love complexity .
and so now we can look one degrees , two degrees , three degrees away from that no@@ de and eliminate three-quarters of the di@@ agra@@ m outside that sphere of influence .
for example , in my first ted@@ talk , i did propose that we should spend 21 billion hours a week as a planet playing video games .
they help us stay connected with people in our social network that we would otherwise grow distant from , if we weren &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t playing games together .
my brain started telling me , jane , you want to die .
even people were playing it for terminal diagno@@ ses like als .
it seems that somehow , a traumatic event can unlock our ability to lead a life with fewer regrets .
go !
all right , pick one , last quest : shake someone &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s hand for six seconds , or send someone a quick thank you by text , email , facebook or twitter . go !
pretty clever , right ?
on the right hand side , that bit there is part of an installation that is about 12 feet long .
by this stage the project had taken on a viral dimension of its own , which got completely beyond us .
the first one she did was knit@@ ting .
now mathemati@@ cians have answered that question .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a bit like this : imagine that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d only ever encountered eu@@ cli@@ dean space .
and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s true . but it also goes deeper than that .
he believed that the crystal was the model for all kinds of representation .
so you can then map function onto structure , and then find out what the circu@@ it@@ ry &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s doing to generate that particular function .
and then what happens is , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a blow to your head , damaging the corte@@ x , allowing these lat@@ ent sexual urges to emerge , fla@@ ming to the surface , and suddenly and inexpli@@ cably you find yourself being sexually ar@@ ou@@ sed by your mother .
and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s fortunate , because we can put two electro@@ des on your palm and measure the change in skin resistance produced by sweating .
there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s no delu@@ sion through the phone .
the phantom lim@@ b -- they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll say , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; but doctor , the phantom lim@@ b is paraly@@ zed .
maybe you can relieve the phantom pain , the phantom cra@@ mp .
and he says , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; oh my god , my phantom is moving again . i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t believe this !
and i said -- i got worried , i said , my god , i mean i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve changed this guy &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s body image , what about human subjects , ethics and all of that ?
bear in mind , these people are completely normal in other respects .
now remember -- why does this happen ?
here , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got mar@@ tian alphabet .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s kind of a well-@@ kept secret .
and i think that as we look at culture , we kind of come to understand how we got to where we are .
what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s more , they are able to walk upright for long distances .
you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re happy .

we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re learning how to communicate with them , in really high-@@ pitched tones .
each one is like a sun with a retin@@ ue of planets or@@ biting around it .
and , as we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve learned in the last few years , galaxies are held together by the gravit@@ ational pull of so-called dark matter : particles in huge swar@@ ms , far smaller even than atomic nu@@ cle@@ i .
the geometri@@ c mean of the mass of a pro@@ ton and the mass of the sun is 50 kilograms , within a factor of two of the mass of each person here .
and also , when a scientist makes a discovery , he or she normally has no clue what the applications are going to be .
but even in this concer@@ tin@@ a@@ ed cosmic perspective , our century is very , very special , the first when humans can change themselves and their home planet .
these human-@@ induced alter@@ ations occupying overall less than a million@@ th of the el@@ ap@@ sed lifetime and seemingly occurring with runaway speed ?
what was interesting about the article was people started commenting on the article , readers of the thing .
so some people got this slip of paper and five dollars .
they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re also fairly wealthy and affluent and all these other sorts of things .
perfectly nice thing to do .
i would be a jer@@ k and not tell you what it is , but in fact , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s central african republic .

michael norton : how to buy happiness
in spite of the very clear anti-@@ israeli ideology of the new regime , the geopolitical logic for their collaboration lived on , because they still had common threats .
the bush administration did not even respond .
the cry of &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; raw data now ! &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
how can you use this stuff ?
so , now we have , immediately , a real-time map showing where there are refugee camps -- rapidly became the best map to use if you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re doing relief work in port-@@ au-@@ prince .
okay , so we have a democracy , no doubt , but it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s dependent upon the le@@ sters and dependent upon the people .
there are rich le@@ sters , poor le@@ sters , black le@@ sters , white le@@ sters , not many women le@@ sters , but put that to the side for one second .
this is a system that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s designed to save the status quo , including the status quo of big and invasive government .
so it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not that mine is the most important issue . it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s sol@@ vable , not by being a democrat , not by being a republican .
a government dependent upon the people alone .
it began the space race .
i was sent to a place , a psy@@ ch ward , and in the psy@@ ch ward , everyone is doing their own one-@@ man show .
now recently , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s been development in this field .
this is a room full of intelligent people , highly sensitive .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll show you a computer model made by iain cou@@ zin , a researcher at oxford , that shows how swar@@ ms work .

so already , the simulator is making me walk in exactly the same way as our witnesses walked on the real bridge .
you don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t see it in the newspaper every day .
so , i want to tell you that the piece of the good news is that the fowler apple is still out there .
in short , the answer is that in the future , in many countries , the col@@ dest growing seasons are going to be hotter than anything those crops have seen in the past .
we have collected and con@@ served a great deal of biological diversity , agricultural diversity , mostly in the form of seed , and we put it in seed banks , which is a fancy way of saying a freezer .
when you open up the front door , this is what you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re looking at . it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s pretty simple . it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a hole in the ground .
agriculture takes 70 percent of fresh water supplies on earth .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s time again to talk about &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; in@@ convenient truth , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; a truth that everyone is concerned about , but nobody is willing to talk about .
another benefit of wi-fi , we learned yesterday about the benefits of wi-fi .
i want to start off by saying , houston , we have a problem .
that has not happened at all in space flying .
three years , and we can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t do that now . crazy .
and it will be sub-@@ or@@ bital . and the reason it has to be sub-@@ or@@ bital is , there is not solutions for adequate safety to fly the public to orbit . the governments have been doing this -- three governments have been doing this for 45 years , and still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died .
these people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area , and i think it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a lot better than they put it in an area of a better cell phone or something -- but they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re putting it in very -- areas and this will lead us into this kind of capability , and it will lead us into the next really big thing and it will allow us to explore . and i think eventually it will allow us to coloni@@ ze and to keep us from going extinct .
100 million bucks -- hey , i can go to the moon .
the technology revolution is opening the world .
now , what is openness ?
he viewed talent differently .
now , the third meaning and corresponding principle of openness is about sharing .
social media didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t create the revolution ; it was created by a new generation of young people who wanted jobs and hope and who didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t want to be treated as subjects anymore .
people didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t know about things .
it protects the birds .
so why should we care about blood vessels ?
so here we go .
in effect , when we give cancer patients anti@@ an@@ gio@@ genic therapy -- here , an experimental drug for a gli@@ oma , which is a type of brain tumor -- you can see that there are dramatic changes that occur when the tumor is being star@@ ved .
and , in fact , the first pioneering treatments for people , as well as dogs , are already becoming available .
the active ingredient &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s res@@ ver@@ at@@ rol , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s also found in red wine .
now , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve shown you a bunch of lab data , and so the real question is : what is the evidence in people that eating certain foods can reduce an@@ gio@@ genesis in cancer ?
the really , truly interesting thing about this is that we can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t take these obese mice and make them lose more weight than what the normal mouse &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s weight is supposed to be .
for the last 20 years i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve been designing puzzles .

the artist m.@@ c. e@@ scher exploited that in some of his wonderful prints .
well , let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s first of all simpli@@ fy the v@@ ases illusion , make the thing on the right .
the first move is going to be what ?
but it takes some persi@@ stence .
why ? well , we aging boom@@ ers , baby boom@@ ers , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re eating our healthy food , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re exercising . what about our minds ?
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s his hair . you get a lot of figu@@ re-@@ ground problems .
i think the whole world has essentially been brought up not to be a girl .
their stories were so horrific , and so mind-@@ blowing and so on the other side of human existence , that to be perfectly honest with you , i was shattered .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve traveled , as i said , to many , many countries , and i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve seen , if we do what we do to the girl inside us then obviously it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s horrific to think what we do to girls in the world .
i know a 14-year-old girl in the netherlands , for example , who is demanding that she take a boat and go around the entire world by herself .
she taught girls what a healthy vag@@ ina looked like , and what a mu@@ ti@@ lated vag@@ ina looked like .
and when she got to the house she was greeted .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s all bad . my brothers get everything . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
i re@@ jo@@ ice that it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s still in my body .
thank you very much .
sent to prison , adam@@ antly insisting on his innocence , which he has consistently for 21 years .
this is looking directly across the street from where they were standing .
some of the teenagers said that in fact the car was 15 feet away when it shot .
and what does this example -- what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s important to keep in mind for ourselves ?
and this blew his mind . literally . he checked into a sanit@@ arium .
so nature has this self-@@ similar structure .
well , i noticed that line is about where the only square building in the village is at .
first of all , i agree with mu@@ dim@@ be &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s wonderful book , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; the invention of africa , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; that africa is an artificial invention of first colonialism , and then opposi@@ tional movements .
here &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a wonderful fra@@ c@@ tal .
and one of them said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; come here . i think i can help you out here . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
so let me end with just a few words about applications that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve found for this .
so if we want to find a better way of doing that kind of work , we need look only no farther than africa to find these robust self-@@ organizing algorithms .
at 7 p.m. on a sunday in hidden springs , idaho , where the six members of the starr family are sitting down to the highlight of their week : the family meeting .
he read 30 years of harvard business review before stumbling upon an article in 1986 called &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; the new new product development game . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
he said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; you can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t underestimate the power of doing this . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
it felt like we were kind of laying these underground cables that wouldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t light up their world for many years to come .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll have family breakfast . we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll meet for a bedtime snack .
so we said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; okay , give us a reward and give us a punishment . okay ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
jim collins , the author of &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; good to great , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; told me that successful human organizations of any kind have two things in common : they preserve the core , they stimulate progress .
researchers at em@@ ory gave children a simple &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; what do you know &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; test .
that story perfectly captures for me the final lesson that i learned : happiness is not something we find , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s something we make .
a wind@@ shield coating is going to give you about 110 degrees .
and i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to leave you with one last demonstration , but before i do that , i would like to say thank you , and think small .
and that was that she did two entire shows promoting that movie &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; the secret . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
when a word was mentioned , an image of it instantly appeared in his mind .
a world telegra@@ phy center -- imagine news , messages , sounds , images delivered to any point in the world instantly and wi@@ relessly .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s been around for about 7,000 years .
again , we are making holes in the skull about the size of a di@@ me , putting an electro@@ de in , and then this electro@@ de is completely underneath the skin down to a pac@@ e@@ maker in the chest , and with a remote control very much like a television remote control , we can adjust how much electricity we deliver to these areas of the brain .
so here he is .
so we went ahead and im@@ planted electro@@ des in patients with depression .
and indeed , at the top , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll see before the surgery , the areas in blue are the areas that use less glucose than normal , predominantly the par@@ ie@@ tal and tempor@@ al lo@@ bes .
i get to do this all the time , and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s just incredible .
and they can be modeled by a spr@@ ing-@@ mass system that we call the spring mass system because we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re biome@@ chan@@ ists . it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s actually a po@@ go stick .
this is a collaboration we have with stanford .
we couldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t believe that it could do this . it said to us that if you could build a robot with very simple , spring@@ y legs , you could make it as maneu@@ ver@@ able as any that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s ever been built .
like if we had a piece of tape now , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d peel it this way .
but that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re limited to , at the moment .
and just recently we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve made a breakthrough , where we now believe we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to be able to create the first synthetic , self-@@ cleaning , dry ad@@ he@@ sive . many companies are interested in this .
we also have another problem , which is that women face harder choices between professional success and personal fulfil@@ l@@ ment .
i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t have the right answer .
he reads one book of 12 and goes to a couple of lectures , marches himself up to our room a couple days before the exam to get himself tut@@ ored .
but it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not that simple .
and she said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; i learned something today .
message number three : don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t leave before you leave .
they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re just not moving .
when people don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t take their pills , when people don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t follow doctors &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; orders -- these are behavior problems .
they would get dent@@ ures , and if you got dent@@ ures , you weren &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t going to be able to eat cor@@ n-@@ on-the-@@ co@@ b , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll eat mu@@ sh for the rest of your life .
this is still the way we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re communicating messages about health .
we should probably slow down , and that point of action is probably now .
this is an approach that has been developed by a couple researchers at dar@@ tm@@ outh medical school , lisa schwartz and steven wol@@ o@@ shin .
so that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what i want to walk you through .
so we thought the patient might actually want to know the context as well .
but we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re not using it . it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s just sitting there .
i want to say a word for nature because we haven &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t talked that much about it the last couple days .
the bee is not calling the shots .
u@@ gh . mini-@@ me .
now , the other use of this is practical .
he waits three days , and then we to@@ wed in something called the eg@@ g@@ mobile .
and the species in the soil go to work basically che@@ wing through those roots , de@@ com@@ posing them -- the earth@@ worms , the fung@@ i , the bacteria -- and the result is new soil .
and so i say that i want to build a game layer on top of the world , but that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not quite true because it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s already under construction ; it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s already happening .
and if you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re happy with that , fantastic .
so the first one -- the most famous appointment dynamic in the world -- is something called happy hour .
you should get points for doing this on time .
why go from an a to an f or a b to a c ?
and we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve introduced a progression dynamic into it , where , by going to the same place over and over , by doing challenges , by engaging with the business , you move a green bar from the left edge of the screen to the right edge of the screen , and you eventually unlock rewards .
this next decade is the decade of games .
so you can see : here we are in the u.s. , and they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re all coming up red .
and if we can switch to slides -- all right , here we go .
they run google ads , and we just give them the ad credit so they can let organizations know .
you can see , even though the u.s. is still the majority here -- though , by the way , sear@@ ch-@@ wise , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s only about 30 percent of our traffic -- but it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s already going to japan , and the u.k. , and europe , and all the rest of the countries .
i think usually , as companies get bigger , they find it really hard to have small , innovative projects .
fro@@ o@@ gle lets you search shopping information , and blogger lets you publish things .
but the idea is , like , on a newspaper , for example , we show you relevant ads .
so , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; related searches , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; right there . you can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t see it that well , but we decided we should put in this feature into our ad@@ sense ads , called &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; related searches . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
now this rather old photo up there is actually the first project i was ever hired to do , something like 25 years ago .
and to do that meant creating the flat@@ test gra@@ di@@ ents that had ever yet been made , which meant building long vi@@ adu@@ cts across river valle@@ ys -- this is actually the vi@@ adu@@ ct across the thames at mai@@ den@@ head -- and long tunnels such as the one at box , in wiltshire .
what makes technology useful and usable ?
and instead of installing the large-scale machines used by western producers , they used low-cost c@@ ad / cam proto@@ typing technology .
now the industrial systems of brun@@ el &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s time have run their course , and indeed they are part of the problem today .
so for me , this project shows kind of how far we can go from some of those sort of small things that i was working on at the beginning of my career .
in response , he gave me an even more cour@@ teous version of the same explanation .
people must choose for themselves , sometimes sticking to their guns , regardless of what other people want or recommend .
the assumption then that we do best when the individual self chooses only holds when that self is clearly divided from others .
of course , you and i know that coke is the better choice .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not a marker of liberation , but of suf@@ fo@@ cation by meaningless min@@ uti@@ ae .
in france , the doctors decided whether and when the life support would be removed , while in the united states , the final decision rested with the parents .
but the history books and the daily news tell us it doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t always work out that way .
and so one time i was in a beauty salon , and i was trying to decide between two very light shades of pink .
she@@ ena i@@ y@@ eng@@ ar studies how we make choices -- and how we feel about the choices we make . at ted@@ global , she talks about both trivial choices and profound ones , and shares her groundbreaking research that has uncovered some surprising attitudes about our decisions .
then i was so happy that i kept playing with the robot , and so you see the robot has a front ru@@ dder here .
so i brought to you for the first time on the ted stage prote@@ i number eight . it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not the last one , but it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a good one for making demos .
this is a proud member of prote@@ i from korea , and on the right side , this is a multi@@ ple-@@ ma@@ sts design proposed by a team in mexico .
when senior fellow cesar har@@ ada heard about the devastating effects of the bp oil spill in the gulf of mexico in 2010 , he quit his dream job and moved to new orleans to develop a more efficient way to soak up the oil . he designed a highly maneu@@ ver@@ able , flexible boat capable of cleaning large tra@@ cts quickly . but rather than turn a profit , he has opted to open-@@ source the design .
ph : there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s been an uneasy relationship between the tv business and the tech business , really ever since they both turned about 30 .
i mean , how did a machine that was built for accounting and artillery mor@@ ph into media ?
enter the atomic bomb .
and then , the 92 nuclear power plants that it would take to provide the power would fill up the rest of los angeles .
then take it and put it right up against the screen of your own television set , and rub it out from the center to the corners , like this .
if you substitute the word blo@@ go@@ sphere , of the internet today , it is very true that his understanding is probably very enligh@@ tening now . let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s listen in to him .
and into that fer@@ ment came the micro@@ processor .
this method allows you to use existing video@@ disc materials in ways which suit your specific needs and interests .
in 1939 , the radio corporation of america introduced television .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a customer , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s an audience , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a person who &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s participating .
voice 2 : well , there goes the neighborhood .
and so every time a new medium arrives , the old medium is the content , and it is highly observ@@ able , highly noticeable , but the real , real rou@@ gh@@ ing up and massa@@ ging is done by the new medium , and it is ignored .
i was walking around on the streets of amsterdam and i recognized , you know , the big story from amsterdam isn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s in the design stores , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s out on the streets , and maybe it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s self-@@ explan@@ atory , but a city that hasn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t been taken over by moderni@@ sm , that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s preserved its kind of architecture and character , and where the bicycle plays an important part of the way in which people get around and where pedestrian rights are protected .
it takes your attention ; it has a great amount of emotion ; it star@@ es back at you the way that a figure might .
the dutch are good also , but the italians are good .
and i do think pattern has the capability of eradi@@ cating some of the most evil forces of society , such as bad form in restaurants , but quite seriously , it was a statement to me that one thing that you do , sort of , see is the aggressive nature of the industrial world has produced -- kind of , large masses of things , and when you -- in mono@@ culture , and i think the preservation of diversity in culture is something that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s important to us .
rob forbes , the founder of design within reach , shows a gallery of snap@@ shots that inform his way of seeing the world . charming ju@@ x@@ ta@@ positions , found art , urban patterns -- this sli@@ de@@ show will open your eyes to the world around you .
so i built model airplanes .
and for the following 25 years , living in italy , living in america , i dol@@ ed out a piece of this romance to anybody who &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d pay for it -- this sense , this aesthetic feeling , for the experience revol@@ ving around a designed object .
and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the way i work now .
he reached down . he pulled a lever . and the chair sank down .
would everybody put their hand under their bottom and feel their tail@@ bone ?
ideally you want to put the head support in the cran@@ ial area , right there .
now let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s assume you go on holiday .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s two days ago .
clearly the product you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got has got to be safe to humans .
a single female will lay about up to 100 eggs at a time , up to about 500 in her lifetime .
so freight costs aren &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t our biggest problem .
i found myself in a hospital in an intensi@@ ve-@@ care ward , recu@@ per@@ ating from emergency surgery .
so , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not really simple when somebody asks you , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; where do you live , where do you work , and where do you spend all your time ?
no doctor , can i remember , ever asking me , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; where have you lived ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and all of those black dots are all of the toxic release invent@@ ories that are monitored by the epa .
and i would say he got it right almost a decade ago .
i am the emperor of orange@@ s . i am the emperor of orange@@ s . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to start by asking you a question : is anyone familiar with the blue algae problem ?
cell membran@@ es are phosphor@@ us-based : these are called phosp@@ holi@@ pi@@ ds .
you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to tell me it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s waste@@ ful .
what are we to do ? we are faced with a paradox .
and over time , this mushroom has evolved and adapted to seek out even the tin@@ iest trace of phosphor@@ us , and to put it to use , to make it available to the plant .
my@@ cor@@ rhi@@ za was used in one field but not in the other .
so , examples like christopher w@@ ren &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s king &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s cross : you can see that the structural forces of the vaul@@ ting get articul@@ ated as lines , so you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re really actually seeing the expression of structural force and form .
now , typically you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d think that they would all be the same : like , the chairs you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re sitting in would all be the same dimension .
and here we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve broken the 500 apartments up into small neighborhoods , and differenti@@ ated those neighborhoods .
that way , each one of these tools we could pay for with a few hundred dollars , and get incredible variation in the components .
finally , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d like to just show you some of the effects of using digital fabri@@ cation .
if we go a little bit further south in our little tour of the world , we can go to the boli@@ vian edge of the amazon , here also in 1975 , and if you look really carefully , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a thin white line through that kind of se@@ am , and there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a lone farmer out there in the middle of the prime@@ val jungle .
well , the colorado on a typical day in the 1950s , this is just , you know , not a flood , not a drought , kind of an average day , it looks something like this .
let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s put it that way .
and yet , we don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t talk about it very much .
the green areas here show where corn yields , just showing corn as an example , are already really high , probably the maximum you could find on earth today for that climate and soil , but the brown areas and yellow areas are places where we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re only getting maybe 20 or 30 percent of the yield you should be able to get .
we need to face &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; the other in@@ convenient truth . &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; a global crisis in agriculture .
and there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s nothing we do that is more crucial to our survival .
and i thought she &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d say , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; oh , you know , up the lago@@ on somewhere , or maybe across africa , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; but you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll be happy to know she said it came from here , it comes from the north sea .
so it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s vast . but it should come with an aster@@ is@@ k , and the aster@@ is@@ k is that it exclu@@ des two thirds of the workers of the world .
they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to ed@@ dy in lagos .
first , it would be to understand that it could be considered a cooperative , and this is a thought from the brazilian legal scholar roberto man@@ gab@@ eira unger .
there are also some children who are born without arms , called con@@ gen@@ ital lim@@ b defici@@ ency .
there are several available on the market , and here you see a few .
imagine , with somebody who &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s lost their whole arm , we still have four major nerves that go down your arm .
and i challenge anybody in the room to make their chest go like this .
you see him with his original device on the left there after eight months of use , and on the right , it is two months .
i could work them just by my thoughts .
ak : so i have the elbow that goes up and down .
here &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s amanda using an arm made by de@@ ka research corporation .
but look at all the electro@@ des around it .
todd ku@@ i@@ ken : a pros@@ thetic arm that &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; feels &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
also , research within the continent is a lot easier to conduct due to widespread poverty , endemic diseases and inadequate health care systems .
public accountability needs to be promoted through transparency and independent review by non@@ governmental and international organizations as appropriate .
now , there are around a thousand trucks and buses and cars there .
and , more importantly , they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re well-@@ dressed .
where it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s blue and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s green , it means the water is really cold .
and so we have this penguin project . the wildlife conservation society has funded me along with a lot of individuals over the last 27 years to be able to produce these kinds of maps .
because we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve solved the problem in chu@@ but province , which is like a state in argentina where pun@@ ta tom@@ bo is -- so that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s about 1,000 kilometers of coastline -- but we haven &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t solved the problem in northern argentina , uruguay and brazil .
turbo &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s never been fed .
here &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a female that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s in a hurry . she &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s got food .
for them , nations , countries , boundaries , borders still matter a great deal , and often violently .
as you can see on this map , russia is still the largest country in the world .
they set up their own ba@@ za@@ ars and medical clinics .
specifically , it targets japan and korea and australia , countries that are strong allies of the united states .
so what can we do to think about borders differently in this part of the world ?
what might ? i believe that what might solve the problem is infrastructure .
and i assure you it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s every bit as important to them as it might have been to coloni@@ zers and imperi@@ alists .
in 2004 , 15 new countries joined the e.@@ u .
the post-@@ colonial entro@@ py that is happening around the world is accelerating , and i expect more such changes to occur in the map as the states frag@@ ment .
many people think the lines on the map no longer matter , but par@@ ag khanna says they do . using maps of the past and present , he explains the root causes of border conflicts worldwide and proposes simple yet cun@@ ning solutions for each .
and next you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to see the long-@@ lived mut@@ ant when it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s young .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s like . and you would never know .
now you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve all heard of at least insulin .
so it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s really interesting , and it makes sense in a way , that they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re still young , so why would they be getting diseases of aging until their old ?
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s how it works . that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s why we don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t see the long life@@ span , until we have the da@@ f-@@ 2 mut@@ ant .
and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the case all over the world , as you can see from these stars .
although you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re looking for a drug that can solve aging in old men like me , what you could do now pretty well in the lab , if you were allowed ethi@@ cally , is start a human life from scratch with altered genes that would make it live for a lot longer ?
if you look at birds , which live a long time , cells from the birds tend to be more resistant to a lot of different environmental stresses like high temperature or hydrogen per@@ oxide , things like that .
as you can see , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s impossible to read .
here &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s another good article about a new campaign opposing privati@@ zation of transit without any contact information for the campaign .
which leads us to the last one , which is our elections .
i can see i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got my work cut out for me here .
now to begin to overcome our ignorance of the role of brain chemistry in brain circu@@ it@@ ry , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s helpful to work on what we bi@@ ologists call &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; model organisms , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; animals like fruit flies and laboratory mice , in which we can apply powerful genetic techniques to mole@@ cul@@ arly identify and pinpoint specific classes of neurons , as you heard about in allan jones &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s talk this morning .
valence means good or bad , positive or negative .
you can train a fly to avoid an odor , shown here in blue , if you pair that odor with a shock .
modern psychiatric drugs treat the chemistry of the whole brain , but neuro@@ biologist david anderson believes in a more nuanced view of how the brain functions . he illumin@@ ates new research that could lead to targeted psychiatric medications -- that work better and avoid side effects . how &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s he doing it ? for a start , by making a bunch of fruit flies angry .
so we set up an experiment whereby we put a naked volunteer in a large cage , and in that cage we released mosquit@@ os to see where they were biting on the body of that person .
so the problem that we face with this is that , throughout the landscape , all these pools of water with the lar@@ vae , they are scattered all over the place , which makes it very hard for an inspector like this to actually find all these breeding sites and treat them with inse@@ cti@@ cides .
here we go .
but not all patients on the transplant wait list are so fortunate .
and in my mind , i realized as a surgical pioneer that the purpose of my position of influence was surely to speak up for those who have no influence .
and so guess what , scientists around the world and in the labs are racing to convert aging adult cells -- aging adult cells from you and me -- they are racing to re@@ program these cells back into more useful i@@ ps cells .
stem cells may be used to deliver growth factors to repair damaged heart muscle or be differenti@@ ated into heart muscle cells to restore heart function .
and here are the results of this wonderful project that is the system in venezuela .
so what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s going on when it doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t ?
but here &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s going on here .
yeah .
and for the good of your relationships , i would encourage you to do the same .
but we don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t know where , since we don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t know how to read the pattern .
first , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s clearly a non-@@ invasive , wireless form of communication .
you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re familiar with these cells because they are the ones that frustr@@ ate you when you try to sw@@ at the fly .
whenever a fly reaches the mid@@ point of the chamber where the two odor streams meet , it has to make a decision .
whenever it comes up to the mid@@ point , it paus@@ es , it carefully scans the odor interface as if it was sni@@ ffing out its environment , and then it turns around .
the other piece of good news , for a scientist at least , is that much remains to be discovered .
and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s dependent on passive patients who just take it and don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t ask any questions .
thomas bat@@ u@@ ik : hi there , eric .
and you just saw a little bit of the first two with my interaction with dr. bati@@ uk .
i had my own heart scare years ago in graduate school , when we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re under treatment for the kidney , and suddenly , they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re like , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; oh , we think you have a heart problem . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
these population studies that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve done have created tons of miracle drugs that have saved millions of lives , but the problem is that health care is treating us as averages , not unique individuals , because at the end of the day , the patient is not the same thing as the population who are studied . that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s leading to the gu@@ ess@@ work .
so &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; thank you &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; feel likes a really trit@@ e word , but thank you from the bottom of my heart for saving my life .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s kel@@ lar autumn , my former ph.d. student , professor now at lewis and clark , literally giving his first-@@ born child up for this test .
oh . one thing i want to point out is , look at stick@@ y@@ bot .
and when i went back to research this , i realized that one of the great ted moments in the past , from nathan , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve talked about an active tail .
for those of you who remember your physics , that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a zero-@@ ang@@ ul@@ ar-@@ momentum righ@@ ting response . but it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s like a cat .
so we can maneu@@ ver this way .
but then as it gets closer to the tree , look at the close-@@ up . and see if you can see it land .
so i will spend a little time at the end .
well , the problem is that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got very complicated forces in the climate system .
this was -- this is south of the ant@@ arctic circle .
it took about 10 years to put this project together .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve actually changed the temperature in the last century just the right amount .
and it been growing for about 600 years .
the coral can take us back hundreds and thousands of years .
so i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll close with a short discussion of ocean aci@@ di@@ fication .
now , what that means is that all of the organisms that live in the sea have evolved in this chemo@@ stat@@ ted ocean , that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the reason that they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re not able to respond or adapt to this rapid aci@@ di@@ fication that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s going on right now .
the idea goes like this : imagine space is a sub@@ str@@ ate of all there is .
he said , if i want to describe one more force , maybe i need one more dimension .
some of you guys will fix that one day , but anything that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not flat on a screen is a new dimension , goes smaller , smaller , smaller , and way down in the micro@@ scopic depths of space itself , this is the idea , you could have additional curled up dimensions -- here is a little shape of a circle -- so small that we don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t see them .
this something else is this dancing fi@@ lament of energy .
and that question is this : when we look around the world , as scientists have done for the last hundred years , there appear to be about 20 numbers that really describe our universe .
and if you watch these little fel@@ lows vibr@@ ating around -- they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll be there in a second -- right there , notice that they way they vibr@@ ate is affected by the ge@@ ome@@ try of the extra dimensions .
and now string theory comes along and says , yes , gravity , quantum mechanics , electro@@ magne@@ tism , all together in one package , but only if the universe has more dimensions than the ones that we see .
what i want to talk about is not that context is everything , but why is context everything .
the one on the left comes from an orange surface , under direct light , facing to the right , viewed through a sort of a blu@@ ish medium .
so , if i could have the lights down up here .
but i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m not going to change anything within those boxes , except their meaning .
move your eyes around , blink , maybe close one eye .
and they land on the flower . they stick their tongue in there , called a pro@@ bo@@ sc@@ is , and they drink sugar water .
and you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll see there is a line , a faint line going across that image .
so , now , what i want to do : i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to put the middle nine surfaces here under yellow illumin@@ ation by simply putting a filter behind them .
so if you look at security from economic terms , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a trade-@@ off .
and i think that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a fundamentally interesting question .
so you can imagine how that works .
there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s no real word for stuff that makes us secure , but doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t make us feel secure .
i have feeling and reality .
i was born in new york city .
intuitive is just another word for familiar .
an example , a great example , is the risk of smoking .
strong feelings can create a model .
i mean really though , information seems like our best hope .
i said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; well , that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s kind of neat .
couldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t do it . could not wait .
and let me show you what happened .
joachim de po@@ sada : don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t eat the marsh@@ mal@@ low !
this was after 9 / 11 ; the city was in tough times .
and we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve already started construction on section two .
let me show you a slide here which illustrates the character of conflicts since 1946 until today .
and my country relies on its security through military alliance , that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s clear .
my point is that you don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t have to be neutral to talk .
i think that is wrong .
so what can we learn from all of this ?
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s crucial to understand , i believe , because of technology and because of glob@@ alization , societies from bott@@ om@@ -up .
i said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; no , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s -- it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s penguin shit . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and recently , i was in easter island , which is an incredibly beautiful place , and an incredibly mysterious place , because no matter where you go in easter island , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re struck by these statues , called the mo@@ ai .
how long have they been standing in what positions ?
so , this device here is an in@@ visibility clo@@ ak .
this subjects food to a force about 50,000 times that of normal gravity , and oh boy , does it clarify chicken stock .
i mean , can you imagine ? e.@@ t. &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; s ph@@ oning home , and i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m not , like , there ? you know , horrible !
now , this is what tyran@@ no@@ sau@@ rus rex looks like in my living room .
so , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s more and more activity near the boat , and all of a sudden somebody shouts , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s that in the water ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
having explained those , that will set up for what i think will be a different idea about how to go about treating cancer .
so what you can tell is you can tell the difference between an asian person and a european person by looking at their ingredients list .
but sometimes you can learn much more useful things about that .
i mean , i see patients dying every day because we don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t know what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s going on inside of them .
so this is the signature out of which we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re trying to get patterns .
the problem is that , in cancer , there isn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t something else that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s inside of you .
so your house is dealing with leaks all the time , but it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s fixing them . it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s draining them out and so on .
so thank you very much .
february 4th , we posted it on our website . this was before super tuesday .
stage one is a group where people systematically se@@ ver relationships from functional tribes , and then pool together with people who think like they do .
if that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s how you talked , imagine what kind of work would get done .
here is the greatest challenge we face in innovation .
there is , in fact , another stage .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re great ! who is not great ? england ! &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
one of the people we interviewed was frank jordan , former mayor of san francisco . before that he was chief of police in san francisco .
pretty much everybody else who does polls .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to read a few strips .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s why they leave lights on around the house .
it was not until the 14th century that an italian painter recognized the lap as a gre@@ cian temple , up@@ hol@@ stered in flesh and cloth .
apri@@ cot halves like the ears of cher@@ ub@@ im .
and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s too cerebral to anim@@ ate guts and hearts and behavior when the going gets rough .
and in that light , for the religious , compassion also brings us into the territory of mystery -- encouraging us not just to see beauty , but perhaps also to look for the face of god in the moment of suffering , in the face of a stranger , in the face of the vibrant religious other .
jean van@@ ier says that his work , like the work of other people -- his great , beloved , late friend mother teresa -- is never in the first instance about changing the world ; it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s in the first instance about changing ourselves .
but he watched physi@@ cists and chemi@@ sts become the pur@@ ve@@ y@@ ors of weapons of mass destruction in the early 20th century .
rachel naomi re@@ men is a better doctor because of her life-@@ long struggle with cro@@ hn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s disease .
but i rec@@ ited a cheer . i rec@@ ited a cheer along with everybody else .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s different from being shy .
and this turns out to have a special power all its own , because people could feel that these leaders were at the helm , not because they enjoyed directing others and not out of the pleasure of being looked at ; they were there because they had no choice , because they were driven to do what they thought was right .
this is no surprise though if you look at the insights of contemporary psychology .
and they feature as their role models really great sales@@ men .
and even away from the podium , when you called him to say hello , he would often end the conversation pre@@ matu@@ rely for fear that he was taking up too much of your time .
this is especially important for ex@@ tro@@ ver@@ ted children too .
and then i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll come back to the beginning , and tell you a little bit more -- hopefully convince you -- that i believe that in today &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s world , it is really important for business leaders not only to have an idea of what their business is all about , but to have a passion for something that is meaningful .
so , one of our pas@@ sions in our company , and now one of my personal pas@@ sions , is to be able to really work hard at making the technology useful , accessible and affordable .
as a matter of fact , we think reaching 100 percent is very do@@ able , even before the 2015 timeframe . in other parts of emerging countries , such as india and china , the progress has been good -- has been solid , has been good . but in places that are not as developed , places like africa , latin america and other places in the world , the progress has been rather slow . as a matter of fact , i was just recently visiting south africa .
what i mean by that is that in some parts of the world , the government plays a key role in the development of technology .
one example of this has been the one laptop per child .
you have to be a better husband than i was , because that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s how you make progress . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; and now he began to make sense .
i meet a lot of people who are very smart , and say , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; but why can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t i figure out my problems ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
i started it with one other family in 1980 .
and i asked this guy , i said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; well , do you believe that human beings are responsible to make the world a little bit better place for the next generation ?
i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t own a gu@@ es@@ thouse .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s all about more , having more .
when you read this prayer , it sounds incredibly selfish , self-@@ centered .
now , they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re 13 miles up the road in santa ana .
but he doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t do mira@@ cles just to show off .
last year , i was invited to speak at nba all-@@ stars game .
if you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re wired to make deals , you make deals .
and i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t mean that they drop out of school in the third or fourth grade -- they don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t go .
her mother had not gone to primary school .
and somewhere in the middle of south dakota , i turn to my friend and i ask her a question that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s been bo@@ thering me for 2,000 miles .
and finally , i want to convince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so , it is the single greatest moral , intellectual and creative leap you can make .
but there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well -- and this one is cultural .
well the wrong side of her body is in banda@@ ges because the surgeon has performed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one .
the miracle of your mind isn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t that you can see the world as it is .
when it comes to our stories , we love being wrong .
and to me , if you really want to re@@ discover wonder , you need to step outside of that tiny , terrified space of ri@@ ghtness and look around at each other and look out at the va@@ st@@ ness and complexity and mystery of the universe and be able to say , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; wow , i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t know .
one of the ir@@ onies of this whole system is we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re discussing what to do about a system that we don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t understand . we don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t even know what oil is . we don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t know where oil comes from . i mean , literally , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s still a source of debate what this black river of stuff is and where it comes from . the best assumption , and one of the best gu@@ esses in this stuff , is that this stuff comes out of this stuff , that these things absorb sunlight , rot under pressure for millions of years , and you get these black rivers .
what is this ? this is the first transplant of naked dna , where you take an entire dna operating system out of one cell , inser@@ t it into a different cell , and have that cell boot up as a separate species . that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s one month old . you will see stuff in the next month that will be just as important as this stuff .
i happened to buy that motel about three months after vivian started working there .
but given my be@@ fu@@ ddled state of mind , i ended up in the self-@@ help section very quickly .
they didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t even see the in@@ tangible stuff higher up the pyramid .
so as i spent time with leaders in the gn@@ h movement , i got to really understand what they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re doing .
actually , in fact , if you look in the dictionary , many diction@@ aries define pursuit as to &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; chase with hostility . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re asking 10 simple questions -- it is simplicity .
in fact , as leaders , what we need to learn is that we can influence the quality of that unit of production by creating the conditions for our employees to live their calling .
bl : all right . one , two , three .
right ? if you go down below on a boat , your inner ears are you telling you you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re moving . your eyes , because it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s moving in register with the boat , say i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m standing still .
now here , i want to share the stage with someone quite special . right ?
bl : &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; can you help me , henry ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; what good scientist says that , right ?
so we asked larry and natalie hempel to write a commentary situ@@ ating the findings for scientists , right , putting in the references , and we submit it to biology letters .
bl : this is the epit@@ ome of technology . right . okay .
this is terrible , this oil -- it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s in the water .
we feel so good about ourselves .
bi@@ omi@@ mi@@ cry , which is something that is an emerging science , winds up being a very important social justice idea .
california has one of the highest incarceration rates of all the 50 states .
it was a trying and scary thing for a young kid to be going through .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s bad enough on a highway , what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s it going to be like to be in the air ?
this is the world -- there won &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t be you as a pilot . and i know the pilots in the audience aren &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t going to like that -- and i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve had a lot of bad feedback from people who want to be up there , flying around and experiencing that .
wonderful engine .
twenty-@@ three percent said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; yes , as soon as possible . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
wires suck , they really do .
what dr. sol@@ jac@@ ic figured out how to do was separate the co@@ ils in a trans@@ former to a greater distance than the size of those transform@@ ers using this technology , which is not dissi@@ mi@@ lar from the way an opera singer shat@@ ters a glass on the other side of the room .
and then finally , electric vehicles .
imagine , you get one of these things . you want to hang them on the wall .
and nokia as well .
so what happens to all these tox@@ ins when we die ?
we want to eat , not be eaten by , our food .
thank you .
we followed my job , and it seemed like there was nothing that we couldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t do .
they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re exotic . they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re experimental .
so what do we make of all of this ?
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s so clear , yet they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re in denial . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
hospice was for people who were dying , and ter@@ ence wasn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t dying .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s part of our dna as humans , and maybe it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s time our healthcare system -- doctors , patients , insurance companies , us , started accounting for the power of that hope .
well , we collect data from satellites , from airplanes , from ground vehicles , from people .
this process is a very calculated process .
microsoft &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s stephen law@@ ler gives a whirlwind tour of virtual earth , moving up , down and through its hyper-@@ real city@@ sc@@ apes with da@@ zz@@ lingly flu@@ i@@ dity , a remarkable feat that requires staggering amounts of data to bring into focus .
you need also state ownership , especially of land assets , in order to build and roll out infra@@ structures very quickly .
this is a very little known fact about the two countries .
by that comparison , democracy looks very , very good in terms of economic growth .
this is the world development index indicator data in the early 1990s .
these are the two pictures taken of garment factories in guang@@ dong province and garment factories in india .
but nevertheless , the system has moved in a more liberal direction , moved in a more democratic direction .
i believe that the political reforms are a must for china to maintain its growth .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve been spending a lot of time thinking about coffe@@ e@@ houses for the last five years , because i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve been kind of on this quest to investigate this question of where good ideas come from .
and what they noticed was they don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t have a lot of dv@@ rs , they don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t have a lot of micro@@ waves , but they seem to do a pretty good job of keeping their cars on the road .
this is what your office should look like , is part of my message here .
and darwin kept these copi@@ ous note@@ books where he wrote down every little idea he had , every little hun@@ ch .
and so they ask around to a couple of their colleagues , and everybody &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s like , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; no , i hadn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t thought of doing that .
could you go the other way ?
this shift is the most striking in the u.s. and in the u.k. , but it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a global phenomenon .
so we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re living in the age of surging income inequality , especially at the top .
we have superstar bankers .
again , this is no mere hypothetical .
the dystop@@ ia that worries me is a universe in which a few geni@@ uses in@@ vent google and its il@@ k and the rest of us are employed giving them massa@@ ges .
there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s many of them up there .
one in a hundred .
and this one &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the biggest growth industry of all , and at least six out of 10 of the people in this room will die in this form , which is the dwindling of capacity with increasing fra@@ il@@ ty , and fra@@ il@@ ty &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s an inevitable part of aging , and increasing fra@@ il@@ ty is in fact the main thing that people die of now , and the last few years , or the last year of your life is spent with a great deal of disability , unfortunately .
the small idea is , let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s all of us engage more with this in the way that jason has illustrated .
it depri@@ ves euthan@@ asia of its oxygen supply .
my family was on a road trip and we were in the grand canyon .
and this is really what i want to talk to you about today -- about cancer .
so , this really changed my view of looking at cancer .
tumor cells can travel through the blood vessels .
so , is it possible that the tumor cells are going to the skele@@ tal muscle tissue , but once in contact inside the skele@@ tal muscle tissue , myo@@ d acts upon these tumor cells and causes them to become skele@@ tal muscle cells ?
and the grandmother had never let any wester@@ ners ever see her .
and remember this picture , because i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to show you another picture later , but you can see how much she looks like her grandmother , although she looks so western .
and i said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m 28 years old , and i live in hotels , and i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m not married . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
so , i went back to korea , and i went back to hy@@ un-@@ so@@ ok &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s village , and she was gone .
and the more i tried talking to him , the less friendly he was getting .
i just think that -- what little i know about the situation , she has very little chance here of having the kind of life that you probably would like her to have . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and he said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; the second day she was here she made up a list of all of the names of the older kids and the younger kids .
and the third night , we came back , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d just gone out to dinner , where you saw the pictures , and we got to the front desk and the guy at the front desk said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s no other free rooms on your floor tonight , so if you want to put the kids five floors below you , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a room there . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and the whole room filled with smoke in about two seconds .
and i remember , natasha didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t want us opening the door -- sorry , i was trying not to open the door , because we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d spent so much time barri@@ c@@ ading the room .
this is a tri@@ -star , and so they let natasha actually sit in the jump seat .
gene even did a little tile work in the kitchen , which was that , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; once upon a time , there was a beautiful girl that came from hills of korea to live happily ever after in atlanta . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
thank you all of you .
a lot has happened in the last few years , and let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s start with the planets .
in fact , even back during the anci@@ ents , the solar system in that sense would look on a di@@ agra@@ m like this .
most of these are candidates .
so the question is : is that chemical phenomenon universal , or is it something which depends on the planet ?
this understanding of chemistry actually can help us with our daily lives .
can you imagine how small it is ?
let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s start this new revolution at the tail end of the old one , with synthetic biology being the way to transform both our environment and our future .
then , uganda started to turn back , whereas zimbabwe skyrocketed , and some years later south africa had a terrible rise of hiv frequency .
not the drug in itself , but the treatment and the care which is needed around it .
there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a lot of things that we thought , that now , good research , done by african institutions and researchers together with the international researchers , show that that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not the case .
un@@ aids have done good data available , finally , about the spread of hiv .
hans ros@@ ling unvei@@ ls new data visuals that un@@ t@@ angle the complex risk factors of one of the world &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s deadliest diseases : hiv . he argues that preventing trans@@ missions -- not drug treatments -- is the key to ending the epidemic .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s based on purchasing power parity .
we know that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s wrong , because we conducted two great natural experiments in the 20th century to see if geography mattered more than institutions .
let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s call them the killer apps .
meanwhile , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s no scientific revolution anywhere else .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the consumer society , and it prop@@ els economic growth more than even technological change itself .
any society can adopt these institutions , and when they do , they achieve what the west achieved after 1500 -- only faster .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s so true .
and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s all we seem to be caring about recently .
so what this figure shows is that spiders date back to almost 380 million years .
these can be group@@ ed into seven categories .
so i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve colored in the gly@@ cin@@ es again in green , al@@ an@@ ine in red , and the ser@@ ines , the letter s , in purple . and you can see that the top repeat unit can be explained almost entirely by green and red , and the bottom repeat unit has a substantial amount of purple .
what you see here on this tough@@ ness graph is the higher the black dot is on the graph , the higher the tough@@ ness .
to borrow from the writ@@ ings of a spider named charlotte , silk is terrific .
flick@@ r is a photo@@ -@@ sharing service that allows people to take photos , upload them , share them over the web and so forth .
you notice we haven &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t got everybody who has a photo .
and worst of all , that figure at the bottom , approximately ten photos per photographer , is a lie .
this is the math underlying the 80 / 20 rule . right ?
right ? so , when institutions are told they are obstacles , and that there are other ways of coordinating the value , they go through something a little bit like the ku@@ b@@ ler-@@ ross stages -- -- of reaction , being told you have a fatal illness : denial , anger , bargaining , acceptance .
the invent@@ ors don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t know what the invention is .
there are people in the states right now tying themselves into kno@@ ts , trying to figure out whether or not blog@@ gers are journalists .
it was produced by analy@@ zing their communications patterns using a lot of these tools . and doub@@ tless the intelligence communities of the world are doing the same work today for the attacks of last week .
so a baker , and a good baker , knows how to pull or draw forth the inherent sugar trapped in the star@@ ch .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the challenge . okay , so , now , what we -- in the journey of wheat , let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s go back and look at these 12 stages .
this takes a second , but it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a distinctive stage .
and then we have stage 12 , which the text@@ books call &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; packaging , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; but my students call &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; eating . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not only been killed , but it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s been denied any potential for creating future life .
bacteria is in there , eating the same su@@ gars , turning them into acids .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s used as a symbol for transformation .
and i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m not kid@@ ding , i just think we should just say that and move forward .
they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re all mounted on my instruments .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a bunch of crazy pic@@ to@@ graphic not@@ ation .
let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s watch just another clip .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve decided , ultimately , that this is the wrong question , that this is not the important question .
so half the time , she acted as if she liked the cra@@ ckers and didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t like the broccoli -- just like a baby and any other sane person .
if we look across many , many different species of animals , not just us pri@@ mates , but also including other mammals , birds , even mar@@ su@@ pi@@ als like kangar@@ oos and wom@@ bats , it turns out that there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a relationship between how long a childhood a species has and how big their brains are compared to their bodies and how smart and flexible they are .
and at least until they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re 23 , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re still popping those worms into those little open mouths .
then they test that new hypothe@@ sis and so on and so forth .
the first one is , again , remember , these are four year-olds .
oh .
and we even know something about the way the brain does this .
alison gop@@ nik : what do babies think ?
now , the only way to get around that is to actually simul@@ ate the human body and to simul@@ ate that bit of the nervous system of the brain that controls that body .
those are then selected by the algorithm , re@@ produced with mutation and re@@ combinations to introduce sex as well .
now , this might look kind of trivial , but it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s actually very important because this is not something you get at the moment in any interactive or any virtual worlds .
and then , finally hits the floor .
so , they wanted to have a digital version of a stun@@ tman and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve been working on for the past few months .
at the moment , doing something like this by hand would take you probably a couple of days .
there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s so many things we can do with this right now .
we do have one un@@ intentional dancer actually , the last thing i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to show you .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a children &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s book for the ipad .
i remember we cried pro@@ fu@@ sely when the little goats we played with in the summer became bi@@ ri@@ ani .
and my argument &@@ #@@ 9@@ 1@@ ; is &@@ #@@ 93@@ ; that the only way for us to teach creativity is by teaching children perspectives at the earliest stage .
and you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll get paid for it . you can think about it , if you want .
which they do .
let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s create a word processor that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s just a word processor .
there are these &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; wiz@@ ards &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; everywhere .
palm is also , especially in the old days , wonderful about this .
i write the code that fits the world today .
i made a fortune over at pix@@ ar .
in my very last example -- i do a lot of my work using speech recognition software , and you have to be kind of quiet because the software is nervous .
dp : thank you very much .
and the danger is that they can cause roughly what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a pandemic .
and i would say that we can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t give up the rule of law to fight an asym@@ metric threat , which is what we seem to be doing because of the present , the people that are in power , because that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s to give up the thing that makes civilization .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll hear a lot more about that from al gore very shortly .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a strange place inside a nano@@ tube .
we need new anti-@@ vir@@ als and cocktails . we need new kinds of vaccines .
and finally , i think we have to do something that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not really -- it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s almost unacceptable to say this -- which , we have to begin to design the future .
i think it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s time that we transi@@ tioned to a solar system@@ -@@ going civilization and species .
how hard is it going to be to find life on mars ?
i think it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s there , and i think we need to go look for it , and i think it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s underground .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a very simple trick , and i never fail to do it when i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m sitting in a window seat .
in this cave , great areas are covered by this red@@ dish material that you see here , and also these enormous crystals of selen@@ ite that you can see dan@@ gling down .
in order to access these sub-@@ surface environments that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re interested in , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re very interested in developing the tools to do this .
so , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re talking about things like inflatable liners that can con@@ form to the complex top@@ ological shape on the inside of a cave , fo@@ ame@@ d-@@ in-@@ place air@@ locks to deal with this complex top@@ ology , various ways of getting breathing gases made from the intrinsi@@ c materials of these bodies .
but when you tell someone your goal and they acknowledge it , psychologists have found that it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s called a &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; social reality . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and so it is with archi@@ me@@ des , the great greek mathemati@@ cian .
for@@ geries were painted over it , and it suffered very badly from mold .
and so before we could start imaging archi@@ me@@ des , we had to take this book apart .
and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what it looks like .
but as the elec@@ tr@@ ons go round at the speed of light , they shed x-@@ rays .
this was a bad idea , because philip of mac@@ e@@ don had a son called alexander the great , and they lost the battle of cha@@ er@@ one@@ a .
because institutions at the moment con@@ fine their data with copyright restrictions and that sort of thing .
how do you read a two-@@ thou@@ san@@ d-@@ year-old manuscri@@ pt that has been erased , cut up , written on and painted over ? with a powerful parti@@ cle acceler@@ ator , of course ! ancient books curator william noel tells the fascinating story behind the archi@@ me@@ des pal@@ imp@@ se@@ st , a by@@ z@@ antine prayer book containing previ@@ ous@@ ly-@@ unknown original writ@@ ings from ancient greek mathemati@@ cian archi@@ me@@ des and others .
there are very few places in the u.s. where you can try real kobe , and one of them is wolfgang puck &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s restaurant , cut , in los angeles .
they did give me a tour , though .
i did a blind taste test of this with 20 people and five other olive oils .
and to try this -- i couldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t get a lo@@ aner , but i did go into the manhattan show@@ room of the manufacturer , toto , and they have a bathroom off of the show@@ room that you can use , which i used .
most of the cars that i drive , if i get up to 80 they start to r@@ attle .
it was three days , four meals .
and in particular , i think we can learn things about learning .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s from the game world of war@@ craft with more than 10 million players globally , one of whom is me , another of whom is my wife .
now , if you take a game like war@@ craft , you can think about it , if you like , as a great box-@@ opening effort .
no , we want one or two monsters on the screen at any one time .
second , multiple long and short-term aims -- 5,000 pies , boring , 15 pies , interesting .
and what this means is we can predict learning , we can predict enhanced engagement , these windows , these windows of time , in which the learning is taking place at an enhanced level .
let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s start with business .
and through this work , i hope to better understand the evolutionary vulnerabilities of our bodies , so that we can improve and better manage our health in the future .
and so previous studies had only focused on micro@@ scopy .
so i took a job at the united nations world food programme as a way to try to address these security issues through food security issues .
unfortunately , obesity &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not only an american problem .
there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s this large , consolidated farming that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s led to what we eat in america , and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s really been since around 1980 , after the oil crisis , when , you know , mass consolidation , mass exodus of small farmers in this country .
the icons like michael pol@@ lan and jamie oliver in his ted prize wish both addressed this last three-@@ decade time period as incredibly relevant for food system change .
this is a construction helmet that i received two years ago at the groundbreaking of the largest project i , and my firm , have ever been involved in .
but i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to reduce this to the beginning of the process , into three very pe@@ dan@@ tic statements .
if we are so good at our craft shouldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t we be able to concei@@ ve of an architectural manifest@@ ation that slides seamlessly through the project &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s and the client &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s constraints ?
the architectural manifest@@ ation was frankly just dumb .
you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going down into our lobby , go through the lobby with our own little dan@@ gly bits , whether you like them or not , up through the stair that leads you into the auditorium .
and the solution in terms of the balcon@@ ies was to use something that we all know as a score@@ board lift .
this building has the ability , in short order , to go back to a flat floor organization such that they can rent it out .
and to remind you that here is an example in which architecture actually did something .
and i really loved this idea of the partial glimpse into somebody &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s life .
&@@ quo@@ t@@ ; i love how they were able to preserve most in everything that makes you feel close to nature -- butterflies , man-@@ made forests , lime@@ stone ca@@ ves and hey , even a huge python . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
so these are some newer projects that actually aren &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t even launched publicly yet .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re very used to this .
this graph that i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m clicking down here is meant to be reminiscent of a medical heartbeat graph , showing the exciting moments of adrenaline .
so , you have some really happy person holding 10 balloons , and some really sad soul holding one balloon .
he had this amazing series of ha@@ irs growing out of a mole on the left side of his face , which i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m told is very good luck .
one of the more touch@@ y political subjects in bhut@@ an is the use of indian cheap labor that they import from india to build the roads , and then they send these people home once the roads are built .
but i prefer for maybe 40 to 50 .
and you never think you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to be the guy who &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s walking down the street and , because you choose to go down one side or the other , the rest of your life is changed forever .
and — — the nurse kind of had a hysteri@@ cal laugh , and i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m turning my head trying to see everybody , and i had this weird memory of being in college and raising , raising money for the flood victims of bangladesh , and then i look over and my an@@ esthe@@ si@@ ologist is cla@@ mping the mask on me , and i think , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; he looks bangla@@ de@@ shi , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; — — and i just have those two facts , and i just think , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; this could work somehow . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
ed ga@@ vag@@ an : a story about kno@@ ts and surgeons
now of course , as history has gone by , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s been natural for there to be a certain amount of bleed between speech and writing .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re seeing in this fin@@ gered speech .
if you listen to the way black youth today speak , think about the use of the word &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; yo . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
&@@ quo@@ t@@ ; many do not know the alphabet or multipli@@ cation table , cannot write gram@@ mati@@ cally -- &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve heard that sort of thing before , not just in 1956 . 1917 , connecticut school@@ teacher .
and then the third thing would be , please show me a sh@@ ea@@ f of texts written by 16-year-old girls , because i would want to know where this language had developed since our times , and ideally i would then send them back to you and me now so we could examine this lingui@@ stic miracle happening right under our no@@ ses .
gol@@ an levin : software art
it is extremely unlikely the taliban would ever be able to take over the country -- extremely unlikely they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d be able to seize kabul .
and the same is true for the troops .
and yet , nobody listened to them .
very , very sadly , our foreign services , the united nations , the military in these countries have very little idea of what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s going on .
but you need to look at context .
it makes failure invisible , in@@ concei@@ vable and inevitable .
the problem that i want to talk with you about is really the problem of : how does one supply healthcare in a world in which cost is everything ?
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what a hydro@@ phili@@ c surface does .
those half of you , roughly , who are women , at some point may have had a pregnancy test .
there is a very important issue here , which is that because it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a prin@@ ter , a color prin@@ ter , it prints colors . that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what color pr@@ inters do .
so , you take the drop of blood , no further manipul@@ ations , you put it on a little device , the device filters out the blood cells , lets the serum go through , and you get a series of colors down in the bottom there .
and , of course the answer is , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; you don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and we sent it off , and by return mail it came back .
traditional lab tests for disease diagnosis can be too expensive and cumber@@ some for the regions most in need . george white@@ sides &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; ingen@@ ious answer is a fo@@ ol@@ proof tool that can be manufactured at virtually zero cost . &@@ amp@@ ; lt ; em &@@ amp@@ ; gt ; &@@ amp@@ ; lt ; / em &@@ amp@@ ; gt ;
and we think people like this probably don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t want to vote for people who look like this and are named barack obama .
and so we can look at a bunch of different vari@@ ables .
but you see democrats versus republican , not a big difference based on who your neighbors are .
and you interact a lot with your neighbors -- people you like , people you might not know .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m a physician practicing with cutting-edge technology .
he says , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; you see , when she said , &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; good morning , &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; i picked up her fife accent .
so within a few years , in the late 18@@ 00s , early 19@@ 00s , all of a sudden , the barber surgeon had given way to the physician who was trying to make a diagnosis .
there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a real dis@@ junction between the patient &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s perception and our own perceptions as physicians of the best medical care .
and to her , that spoke of a kind of atten@@ ti@@ veness that she needed .
the good news , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not cancer , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not tuber@@ culo@@ sis , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not co@@ cci@@ dio@@ i@@ dom@@ y@@ co@@ sis or some obscure fung@@ al infection .
i would percu@@ ss the chest . i would listen to the heart .
modern medicine is in danger of losing a powerful , old-fashioned tool : human touch . physician and writer abraham ver@@ gh@@ ese describes our strange new world where patients are merely data points , and calls for a return to the traditional one-on-one physical exam .
and the answer is , if you open enough of them , yes .
and in all cases we have to ask -- what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the more likely explanation ?
in the case of gali@@ leo , he had two problems when he turned his telescope to saturn .
faces of all kinds are easy to see .
i guess you can only have one miracle per building .
it was in the top five in 2005 , called , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; nine million bi@@ cycles in beijing . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
heart and blood vessel diseases still kill more people -- not only in this country , but also worldwide -- than everything else combined , and yet it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s completely preventable for almost everybody .
imagine : many of these problems could be prevented if these babies were just kept warm .
over the next five years we hope to save the lives of almost a million babies .
but what do we do for a living ?
and then he went to north carolina and did it again .
and you can build an entire industry on that .
and people in white hats sailing boats .
so some people will go out and get people to be on one team .
someone stands up and says , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; this one is important .
&@@ quo@@ t@@ ; what would happen if every time someone bought a pair of these shoes i gave exactly the same pair to someone who doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t even own a pair of shoes ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
being a leader gives you charisma .
the sensor would have to be in@@ expensive , rapid , simple , sensitive , selective , and minim@@ ally invasive .
you start with some water , pour in some nano@@ tubes , add antibodies , mix it up , take some paper , dip it , dry it , and you can detect cancer .
and so in the next two to five years , this sensor could potentially lift for pancre@@ atic cancer survival rates from a dismal 5.5 percent to close to 100 percent , and it would do similar for o@@ varian and lung cancer .
my experience , however , in the islamic world is very different .
so , for example , there is the character of no@@ ora .
and why does sex make babies , and babies spell ero@@ tic disaster in couples ?
what is the relationship between love and desire ?
and in this space between me and the other lies the ero@@ tic é@@ lan , lies that movement toward the other .
is it a place where you can express your infan@@ tile wishes ?
it won &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t make a dent . there is nobody at the reception desk .
child number two comes back but looks like that over their shoulder all the time .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s focus and presence .
we managed , but sometimes those halls didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t seem exactly suited to the music i was making or had made .
they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re smaller , even less reverber@@ ant , so he can write really fri@@ lly music that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s very intricate -- and it works .
it meant that there could be extreme dynamics , which there weren &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t in some of these other kinds of music .
other singers after him went even further .
and in some ways , the music that they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re writing for this place works perfectly .
and i thought : well , if this is a model for creation , if we make music , primarily the form at least , to fit these con@@ texts , and if we make art to fit gallery walls or museum walls , and if we write software to fit existing operating systems , is that how it works ?
and had such -- it was an eye-@@ opening experience to hear them talk about the world that is yet to come through technology and science .
but this is not the first time that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve had a technological revolution .
and yet he says , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; he re@@ stores my soul . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve seen people take beneficial technological advances , such as the internet we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve heard about tonight , and twist them into something corrup@@ ting .
and i knew mr. do@@ br@@ yn@@ in very well , and i said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to sit beside mrs. gorbachev tonight .
unbearable psychological pressures bear down on us .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s difficult for them to understand that they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to die .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve done a lot of speaking in germany and in france , and in different parts of the world -- 105 countries it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s been my privilege to speak in .
essentially , he said this : &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; if you bet on god , and open yourself to his love , you lose nothing , even if you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re wrong .
i couldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t take it to a laboratory and experiment with it .
life is a right , not collateral or casual .
are you holding her ?
i experience expon@@ entially .
resolutions , smoke .
the women &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s chief of the village has this little girl , fair color like me , totally dirty .
she &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s highly athletic .
today , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve worked with over 300 .
so i will do this .
i want to look back 20 years from now and see that there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s another li@@ berian girl , ghan@@ ai@@ an girl , nigerian girl , ethiopian girl standing on this ted stage .
lg : you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re welcome .
li@@ ck@@ li@@ der fore@@ saw computers doing all the routini@@ zable work that was required to prepare the way for insights and decision making .
every interaction we have in the world is recorded by an ever growing array of sensors : your phone , your credit card , your computer . the result is big data , and it actually presents us with an opportunity to more deeply understand the human condition .
these foreign fighters had left their families in the gulf , the le@@ vant and north africa to join al q@@ aeda in iraq .
the human goal here was to identify camps for relocation based on priority need .
and the reality of the society that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re in is there are thousands and thousands of people out there leading lives of quiet , screaming desperation , where they work long , hard hours at jobs they hate to enable them to buy things they don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t need to impress people they don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t like .
play a sport with a friend at lunchtime .
now i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t mean to mock , but being a fit 10-@@ hour@@ -a-@@ day office rat isn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t more balanced ; it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s more fit .
and that , i think , is an idea worth spreading .
as a black person in america , i am twice as likely as a white person to live in an area where air pollution poses the greatest risk to my health .
so how did things get so different for us ?
who profits ? does anything justify what the local community goes through ?
and they provide habitats for our little friends !
and we are operating with a comprehensive urban planning deficit .
for his brilliant efforts , he was nearly impe@@ ached .
of the 90 percent of the energy that mr. gore reminded us that we waste every day , don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t add wasting our energy , intelligence and hard-@@ earned experience to that count .
she wrote back to me and she said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m so proud to have a son that created the software that allowed these kids to make mother &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s day cards for their mothers . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
it seems that everybody is getting into the act .
and as i move my hand , i can pop the balloons or i can move the bug .
so i showed him .
again , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s useful to think about this analo@@ gy with language .
this is completely different than automobil@@ es .
i want to talk about this .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re interested in finding beauty that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s more than just an aesthetic ; it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s really a truth .
all right ? now one thing about art is , art is discovery , and art is discovering yourself through your art . right ?
hopefully , really understand the customer at its heart , where the customer is , live with them in america . so -- sent the team off , and actually something different happened . they went other places .
the engineers flew over , and designers got together with them , and they put their presentation together .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what you get furious about right ?
chris ban@@ gle : great cars are great art
now as i was training in clinical medicine and hem@@ at@@ ology and oncology and stem cell transplantation , what we had instead , cas@@ c@@ ading through the regulatory network at the fda , were these substances -- arsen@@ ic , th@@ ali@@ domi@@ de and this chemical deriv@@ ative of nitrogen mustard gas .
in effect , the cancer cell was forgetting it was cancer and becoming a normal cell .
and this was , unfortunately , successful .
the first is if anything is unique about this research , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s less the science than the strategy -- that this for us was a social experiment , an experiment in what would happen if we were as open and honest at the earliest phase of discovery chemistry research as we could be .
one thing you can do with a picture like this is simply admire it .
because if there had been , they would have collapsed under the gravit@@ ational pull into a huge black hole .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s our job as co@@ sm@@ ologists .
and this energy , according to einstein , exer@@ ts a push on the universe .
that impli@@ cation was studied by bol@@ tz@@ mann back in the 19th century .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the region where entro@@ py is low .
but we now know enough about the future of the universe to say a lot more .
or maybe the big bang is not the beginning of the universe .
i had never seen an internet .
i felt very happy to be at the secondary school , so i was determined to do anything possible to receive education .
god bless .
so , here , whatever movement i do in my physical world is actually repli@@ cated inside the digital world just using this small device that i made , around eight years back , in 2000 .
i took it very literally , and took my bike helmet , put a little cut over there so that the proje@@ ctor actually fits nicely .
the camera is actually not only understanding your hand movements , but , interestingly , is also able to understand what objects you are holding in your hand .
and why only computers ? we can just play with papers .
pm : there is a lot of energy here . lots of learning .
actually it was a very hard challenge .
if you don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t have open spaces , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got to go there and open spaces .
you can build nice stations .
the first one is , you can change from what i call a &@@ #@@ 9@@ 1@@ ; vicious &@@ #@@ 93@@ ; circle to a virtual circle .
you can imagine how people get happy with me watching these kinds of scenes .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll get to you now the incidents of the day .
that is great , that means we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to have 10 billion minds working together , 10 billion talents together .
in@@ ca sculptures are regarded as treasures in british museums , while shakespeare is translated into every major language of the earth .
darwin himself , by the way , had no doubts that the peacock &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s tail was beautiful in the eyes of the pe@@ ah@@ en .
beautiful shell neck@@ la@@ ces that look like something you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d see at an arts and crafts fair , as well as och@@ re body paint , have been found from around 100,000 years ago .
yes , hair@@ styling -- i insist on that .
we have already an autonomous vehicle .
the system is also smart enough to figure out the safest way to operate the car .
so it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s actually a multi-@@ dimensional user interface .
you must be out of your mind . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
i was leaving a seminar when it started , hum@@ ming to myself , fu@@ mbling with my bag just as i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d done a hundred times before , when suddenly i heard a voice calmly observe , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; she is leaving the room . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
it was at this point that events began to rapidly overtake me .
i used to say that these people saved me , but what i now know is they did something even more important in that they empowered me to save myself , and crucially , they helped me to understand something which i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d always suspected : that my voices were a meaningful response to traumatic life events , particularly childhood events , and as such were not my enemies but a source of insight into sol@@ vable emotional problems .
to parap@@ hra@@ se chavez , once social change begins , it cannot be reversed .
what they remember is , of course , the great triumph , that the brits were beaten , and we won , and that the country was born .
and that makes it extraordinarily interesting as a place to explore .
but better -- what is more important is that they would have to concentrate sunlight .
you see the red glow in their eyes , which is the reflection of the flash@@ light .
they look like , maybe like sun@@ flowers .
i was a teenager , and at 15 or 16 , i guess like all teenagers , we want to just do what we love and what we believe in .
and that allows me to check my timer discre@@ tely , here , without bending my elbow .
i mean , think about it : the care we take in selecting sunglasses , or jewelry , or accessories is really important , so if it isn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t beautiful , it really doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t belong on your face .
so we called it y water . and so this is another place where it all comes together in the same room : the three-@@ dimensional design , the ideas , the branding , it all becomes deeply connected .
in fact , you can see each logo is a little bit different .
and if anybody asks why you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re carrying a con@@ dom , you can just say you like the design .
the first half will be performed by the live singers here on stage .
and what , if anything , do men have to do with it ?
my father , who had fought in three wars , could not save his own sister from this suffering .
&@@ quo@@ t@@ ; he was flat@@ tered .
i see traditional music like a kind of rebellion , in which people can really speak their voice , especially traditional songs from other parts of the former yu@@ go@@ slav republic .
but no , for the protest , they dressed all in white , no makeup .
women like sa@@ ken@@ a and leah and lay@@ ma have humbled me and changed me and made me realize that i should not be so quick to jump to assumptions of any kind .
we can demilitari@@ ze societies and pour resources , instead , into reservoirs of genuine security .
and i thought , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; well , sir , i am not a strategist , nor am i specialist . i am merely a story@@ teller . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
so what could this mean ?
they were together while praying .
and there are two important messages , or two lessons , to take from that reality .
and the religious police im@@ poses the supposed islamic way of life on every citizen , by force -- like women are forced to cover their heads -- wear the hijab , the islamic head cover .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s our faith , and we will be loyal to it .
and this is a question , i think , which needs to be discussed carefully .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s an experience that not every other muslim nation in the middle east had until very recently .
mustafa ak@@ yo@@ l : faith versus tradition in islam
it cle@@ ars the forest , reveals the trees inside .
and antibody stain@@ ings like this one can be used to understand that sort of question .
dar@@ fur may have slipped from the news headlines , but the killing and displacement there continues as well , and the sheer human misery that it creates is very hard to fa@@ thom .
thus , even though every civilian killed , ma@@ im@@ ed , raped , or tortured is one too many , the fact that the number of civilian casualties is clearly lower today than it was a decade ago , is good news .
but then , is northern ireland a unique example , or does this kind of explanation only hold more generally in democratic and developed countries ?
both successes and failures teach us several critically important things that we need to bear in mind if we want the good news to continue .
as a photographer for national geographic , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve portrayed it for many .
mud and minerals become sub@@ str@@ ate ; there are bacteria .
on land , life turned a corner . ja@@ ws formed first ; teeth came later .
extinction can come slowly , but sometimes it arrives fast .
and where it doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t , as in green@@ land in winter , mars is still not very far .
so in australia , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; mo &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; is s@@ lang for mu@@ stache , so we renamed the month of november &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; mo@@ v@@ ember &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; and created some pretty basic rules , which still stand today .
and we persisted , and we got 450 guys growing mu@@ sta@@ ches , and together we raised 54@@ ,000 dollars , and we donated every cent of that to the prostate cancer foundation of australia , and that represented at the time the single biggest donation they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d ever received .
so what we did was , we took some of the money that we raised in australia to bring the campaign across to this country , the u.s , and the u.k. , and we did that because we knew , if this was successful , we could raise infin@@ itely more money globally than we could just in australia . and that money fuels research , and that research will get us to a cure .
so we piled into a taxi , and this is our taxi driver , and i was sitting in the back seat , and he turned around and said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; where are you going ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and so we said , right , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d re@@ defined charity . we need to re@@ define the way these guys operate . how do we do that ?
he could see what was happening to his forest , to his environment , because he was taken under his grandfather &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s wing when he was only two years old to begin to learn about the forest and the way of life of his people .
he would tell you , as he told me , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; i asked myself , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; he said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; what did my grandparents and my great-@@ grandparents do to protect the forest for me ?
we have to change .
even that wasn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t enough .
he would tell you , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m a collector , and i cur@@ ate a museum . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
they have a sense of the great arc of time and their tiny place in it .
he went around once , he went around twice , he went around thri@@ ce .
on the banks of a river called the indu@@ s , now in pakistan .
you should not be si@@ sy@@ ph@@ us , who rolls a rock up a mountain all day only to find the boulder rolled down at night .
you see , the indians also had a river that separates the land of the living from the land of the dead .
the denomin@@ ator of the gym@@ no@@ sop@@ h@@ ist &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s life was infinity .
there is no orchestra conductor .
and i would see the exasper@@ ation between my american and european colleagues , when they were dealing with india .
so , there is nothing right or wrong in what you do in life .
and so the next time you meet someone , a stranger , one request : understand that you live in the subje@@ ctive truth , and so does he .
you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re afraid if you look for your passion and don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t find it , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll feel like you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re an idiot , so then you make excuses about why you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re not going to look for your passion .
you know what ? here &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a little secret .
you need 20 interests , and then one of them , one of them might grab you , one of them might engage you more than anything else , and then you may have found your greatest love in comparison to all the other things that interest you , and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what passion is .
what do you want me to say ?
&@@ quo@@ t@@ ; look kid . i had a dream once , too , but -- but . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s why you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re not going to have a great career , unless -- unless , that most evo@@ cative of all english words -- unless .
you may recall a year ago when a fire@@ storm erupted after the united states preventive services task force reviewed the world &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s mam@@ mo@@ graphy screening literature and issued a guide@@ line recommending against screening mam@@ mo@@ grams in women in their 40s .
so it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s easy to see this tumor in the upper part of this fatty breast .
and sooner or later , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to have to accept the fact that health care innovation can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t always come at a much higher price .
so here we were , a nuclear physi@@ cist , an inter@@ nist , soon joined by carrie h@@ ru@@ ska , a biome@@ dical engineer , and two radi@@ ologists , and we were trying to take on the entrenched world of mam@@ mo@@ graphy with a machine that was held together by du@@ ct tape .
here &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s an example from that screening study .
we still need to complete the screening study using the low dose , and then our findings will need to be repli@@ cated at other institutions , and this could take five or more years .
the babies that we were carrying when my patient first asked me this question are now both in middle school , and the answer has been so slow to come .
i can look at your financial records .
or should we respect his privacy , protect his dignity and leave him alone ?
what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a moral operating system ?
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m just going back and forth ; i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m not getting anywhere .
if you think that way , you have a plat@@ onist moral framework .
not just because it rang earlier , but i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to take it because i made a little calculation .
what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the formula ?
or like kant , did i use reason to figure out what was intrinsi@@ cally right ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
dum ta da da dum dum ta da da dum well , your musician friend will stop you and say , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; you know , the theme music for your data revolution , that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s an opera , that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s wagner .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s our invisible reality .
and this noise is the most neutral .
definitely not perfect . so you would probably shut it , at this point .
you have to know that today , roughly one or two every drug pills is not taken correctly .
i designed it to help kids to follow the treatment .
so , huge tragedy .
because the roots of the plant are not very effective .
now we can eat local food .
so , if you believe the media accounts , being a drug dealer in the height of the crack cocaine epidemic was a very glamorous life , in the words of virginia po@@ stre@@ l .
and in the words of malcolm glad@@ well , crack cocaine was the extra-@@ chunky version of tomato sauce for the inner city .
he was really a curious sight to be seen .
went up to the floor , the second floor , and said : &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; hey , guys .
now , the group i really want you to think about , though , are the ones at the bottom , the foot soldiers .
we found in our gang -- and , admittedly , this was not really sort of a standard situation ; this was a time of intense violence -- of a lot of gang wars -- as this gang actually became quite successful . but there were costs .
but what happened was , the rules changed , and they never got to make partner .
and the words of a gang member capture it quite nicely .
from there i started with sky@@ diving .
2005 i did a base jump from the ei@@ ger , from the monk and from the jung@@ frau , three very famous mountains in switzerland .
i know the answer to this , but how do you land ?
and do you ever say , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; no , no i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m not going to . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
i think there is a soci@@ alizing dimension in , kind of , moving that border .
is art about that ?
so the movement with your legs will change the color of your horizon .
and &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; ha@@ -@@ ha , there is a picture and here is i. and what does it matter ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
in the spectacular large-scale projects he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s famous for , ol@@ a@@ fur eli@@ as@@ son creates art from a palette of space , distance , color and light . this ide@@ a-@@ packed talk begins with an experiment in the nature of perception .
i think that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s got to be sc@@ aring a lot of animals away .
we need a nasa-@@ like organization for ocean exploration , because we need to be exploring and protecting our life support systems here on earth .
when she was 10 years old in 1927 , she published her first book of poems called &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; the jan@@ it@@ or &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s boy . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and my blood froze when i read that because i had written the pla@@ in-@@ song music 130 years after he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d written the letter .
natalie merchant sings from her new album , &@@ amp@@ ; lt ; em &@@ amp@@ ; gt ; leave your sleep . &@@ amp@@ ; lt ; / em &@@ amp@@ ; gt ; lyrics from near-@@ forgotten 19th-century poetry pair with her un@@ mista@@ kable voice for a performance that brought the audience to its feet .
they are very different from us in body form .
so as an adult , when i started to read about the amazing break@@ through@@ s with penny patterson and koko , with sue sa@@ va@@ ge-@@ rum@@ bau@@ gh and kanz@@ i , pan@@ bani@@ sha , irene pepper@@ berg , alex the par@@ rot , i got all excited .
this is what the internet looked like when it was born and you can call that the internet of middle-aged white men , mostly middle-aged white men .
joining me are three of our eight atlantic bottlen@@ ose dolphins : 20-year-old che@@ sa@@ pe@@ ake , who was our first dolphin born here , her four-year-old daughter bay@@ ley , and her half sister , 11-year-old maya .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a number only that congress can appreciate .
what that means is that what we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re learning with these interactions with other species will teach us , ultimately , how we might interact with an alien from another world .
all right , well thank you all so much for joining us .
and now people from iran are talking to me .
they have graphic designers . what ?
and this whole list of pages on facebook dedicated to the same message , to people sending their love , one to each other .
remember that image from the beginning ?
and i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m just going to take a picture of it , and i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m just going to post it on facebook with kind of &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; israelis for peace &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; or something .
as you can see , a project evol@@ ves through a series of generations of design meetings .
but then we had a meeting with a chinese businessman who saw our design and said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; wow , that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the chinese character for the word &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; people . &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; so , apparently this is how you write &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; people , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; as in the people &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s republic of china .
china symboli@@ zed by the dragon .
you can try it .
if you do come to copenhagen , you will probably see an installation by ai wei@@ wei , the chinese artist .
so if you go back into the parking , into the corridors , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s almost like traveling into a parallel universe from cars and colors , into this sort of south-@@ facing urban oasis .
and our main idea was to sort of sample the seven most significant mountains of the topo@@ graphy of azerbaijan and re@@ interpret them into urban and architectural structures , inhab@@ itable of human life .
and i must say , before i go on , i should ask every one of you to try and get out pen and paper because i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that .
because we can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t solve problems .
so what i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m proposing is really to say that we have , for a very long time , had a situation when we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve had a menu of choices .
and then you ask , why economists ?
but it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s saying that what we can do about it is very little , at a very high cost .
the incidence of malaria is about a couple of &@@ #@@ 9@@ 1@@ ; million &@@ #@@ 93@@ ; people get infected every year .
so again , what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment , at first rate .
of course , that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s mainly because climate change has good pictures .
the only two requirements were that they were studying at the university , and they spoke english .
over the past hundred years , the combination of liberal democracy and private capitalism has helped to catapul@@ t the united states and western countries to new levels of economic development .
i put it to you today that it is this system that is em@@ bodied by china that is gathering momentum amongst people in the emerging markets as the system to follow , because they believe increasingly that it is the system that will promise the best and fastest improvements in living standards in the shortest period of time .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m here to also tell you that there are lots of shifts occurring around what china is doing in the democratic stance .
but i put it to you that if the united states and european countries want to remain globally influential , they may have to consider cooperating in the short term in order to compete , and by that , they might have to focus more aggressively on economic outcomes to help create the middle class and therefore be able to hold government accountable and create the democracies that we really want .
in this vein , we can increase economic growth .
that if you live in the best climate , in san diego in the united states , or in the shit@@ ti@@ est climate , in buffalo , new york , you are going to be just as happy in either place .
and so even if we make those very important decisions for very silly reasons , it remains statisti@@ cally true that there are more georges living in georgia and there are more den@@ ni@@ ses becoming denti@@ sts and there are more pau@@ las who are married to paul than statisti@@ cally viable .
and i of course knew stuff , as a designer , about ty@@ po@@ graphy , even though we worked with those animals not so successfully .
after about three days , the bubbles will appear on the surface of the liquid .
and using indi@@ go , make it anti-@@ microbi@@ al .
suzanne , just a curiosity , what you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re wearing is not random .
bao y@@ ong@@ xi@@ u : &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; my mother tells me to come home and get married , but if i marry now , before i have fully developed myself , i can only marry an ordinary worker , so i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m not in a rush . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
many articles calculate : how long would it take for this worker to work in order to earn enough money to buy what he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s making ?
another time , after min had already left the handbag factory , her younger sister came to visit , bringing two coach signature hand@@ bags as gifts .
thank you .
in 2009 , there were 500 bomb blasts across pakistan .
step two : they teach the children the kor@@ an , which is islam &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s ho@@ liest book , in arabic , a language these children do not understand and cannot speak .
this boy is called mess@@ oud .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve flown the cas@@ sin@@ i spacecraft by this moon now several times , flying closer and deeper into these jets , into the den@@ ser regions of these jets , so that now we have come away with some very precise composi@@ tional measurements .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re always sort of small in the face of its expan@@ se .
and that connection is an unequi@@ vocally physical process .
they looked for the un@@ wired places , and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s meant north and south , primarily these cables to africa .
thank you .
and this material that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s deposi@@ ted either starts as a liquid form or a material powder form .
the detail that you can get today is quite amazing .
but it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s very hard to create that in standard ways .
you can just make it physically on the spot .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re now , instead of shipping a product across the world , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re sending data across the internet .
businesses want different things .
but it wasn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t just us . even in the muslim world , his definition of jihad began to gain acceptance .
what does that mean for us in the west ?
but that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s still not reason for us to disen@@ gage , because we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve seen that movie before , in afghanistan .
al jazeera brought information to them , showed them what was being said and done in the name of their religion , exposed the hypocrisy of o@@ sama bin laden and al q@@ aeda , and allowed them , gave them the information that allowed them to come to their own conclusions .
thank you .
i was struck immediately by the kindness and the gent@@ len@@ ess in her face , and i asked her to tell me her story .
she lives with all of that insecurity , and in fact , in january , during the ethnic riots , she was chased from her home and had to find a new sh@@ ack in which she would live .
i truly believe it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s where dignity starts .
by the way , the secret is not to go to sleep until you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve written your words for the day .
i had just taken tri@@ gon@@ ome@@ try in high school , i learned about the par@@ ab@@ ola and how it could concentrate rays of light to a single focus .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m glad you heard earlier today , batteries are unbelie@@ vably energy -- lack of density compared to fuel .
you take a problem that you can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t solve with a pure mathemati@@ cal answer , you build an evolutionary system to try multiple tries at guessing , you add sex -- where you take half of one solution and half of another and then make new mutations -- and you use natural selection to kill off not as good solutions .
so what you see here is 12 separate pet@@ als , that each could be controlled with individual micro@@ pro@@ cessors that would only cost a dollar .
so , once you have mobility , now you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re making a lot of engines because you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got lots of units , as opposed to steam ships or big factories where you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re not making as many units , so this was the engine that ended up benefiting from mass production where all the other engines didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t benefit .
you move that up and down with a little bit of energy but now you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re only shifting the air down to the hot end and up to the cold end , down to the hot end and up to the cold end .
so now you put the two things together .
so this is the first test where we took it outside and each of the pet@@ als were individually seeking .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s just unbelievable what the potential is to take advantage of solar energy there , and i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m really excited to talk more about finding ways we can help with that .
bill gross : a solar energy system that tracks the sun
but still , we look at the pieces .
and out of that field campaign we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll probably get a few dozen papers on a few dozen processes or molecules .
and that was a good thing to help , you know , the cause .
so , good things come out of , you know , in@@ comprehen@@ sion -- -- which i will do a painting of , and then it will end up in my work .
i work for the new yorker , and i do covers , and 9 / 11 happened and it was , you know , a complete and utter end of the world as we knew it .
and &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; would &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; is coco chanel &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s lover , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; should &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; is edith sit@@ well , and &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; could &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; is an august sander subject .
and then , we don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t have a stuffed spin@@ o@@ za , but we do have a stuffed pav@@ lov &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s dog , and i visited him in the museum of hygiene in st. petersburg , in russia .
i received a box in the mail and it was wrapped with newspaper and there was the picture of the man on the newspaper and he was dead .
so -- and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a song about how everybody &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s miserable because , you know , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re from russia .
ma@@ ira kal@@ man : the illustrated woman
but nevertheless , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s no real sense of separation from me in my heart , in terms of the love that i feel for these people .
so , as we are climbing the tree , some of the things that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re doing in order to climb the tree are actually undermining the tree &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s very root .
they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll be cooking , cleaning , buying things , shopping , building . but they aren &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t here .
we were hoping that it w@@ ass going to have a kind of evil , spi@@ der@@ y walk , but instead it created this pretty lame way of moving forward .
katrina showed us that we cannot completely depend on government to have readiness in hand , to be capable of handling things .
for example , all masks are made in china .
add on pandemic threat , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re in big trouble .
let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s see , should we order that all pets be kept indoors ?
in the s@@ ars epidemic , we learned in hong kong that most of transmission was because people were removing their masks improperly .
every city , county , state did their own thing .
the institute of medicine study felt that you could not recycle masks .
clearly the bottom line is the virus eventually atten@@ u@@ ates , and ce@@ ases to be a lethal virus to humanity , and finds other hosts .
in terms of where we are in science with dna identification capacities and so on , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not that far off .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve never seen anything even remotely like this before . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s really maneu@@ ver@@ able . you have a hand-@@ held remote , so you can pretty easily control acceleration , bra@@ king , go in reverse if you like , also have bra@@ king .
okay , i cheated , it was a mere 20 seconds .
but in america you have to explain . what are clubs ?
i found two trees -- but not any kind of trees , trees with character -- and then a very long rope .
the mur@@ mur of the city dissol@@ ves into a squ@@ all whose chilling power i no longer feel .
you know that , right ?
i make the dove appear .
i want you just for a second to experience this amazing human symphony .
and what i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d like to do is take you up to the canopy , not by putting all of you into ropes and har@@ nesses , but rather showing you a very short clip from a national geographic film called &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; heroes of the high frontier . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve done stripping experiments where we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve removed mats of epi@@ phy@@ tes and looked at the rates of recol@@ oni@@ zation .
we consult to the media about canopy questions ; we have a canopy newsletter ; we have an email li@@ st@@ ser@@ v .
i saw the power of duke &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s song with urban youth -- an audience , you know , i as a middle-aged professor , i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t have a hope of getting to -- in terms of convincing them of the importance of wild@@ lands .
i brought my scientific colleagues and sustainability practitioners into the prison .
once upon a time , the world was a big , dysfunctional family .
so we are moving to this democrati@@ zation of information , and i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve been in this field for quite a while .
so that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s open-@@ source and it can be used in any country where there is some kind of freedom of information law .
skepticism , because you must always be challenging .
they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re watching all of us . they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve dug a basement , and they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve built a spy center to try and run algorithms and figure out which ones of us are trouble@@ some , and if any of us complain about that , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re arrested for terrorism .
now , when you think of a coral reef , this is what most people think of : all these big , hard , elaborate cor@@ als and lots of bright , colorful fi@@ shes and things .
over time , those gas molecules dissolve into your blood and tissues and start to fill you up .
and this rig was actually used for a dive of 300 feet .
now , as we breathe , we produce carbon dioxide , and that carbon dioxide needs to be scru@@ bbed out of the system .
and i can talk about it all day -- just ask my wife -- but i want to move on to something that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s kind of much more interesting .
we also see sharks , much more regularly than i would have expected to .
now , i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t know if any of you get u.s. news and world report -- i got the recent issue .
now , this one &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s pretty cool .
the reason i show this -- not to put a dow@@ ner on everything -- but i just want to use it to key off my philosophy of life in general , which is that we all have two goals .
despite the fact that each and every one of these disorders origin@@ ates in the brain , most of these disorders are diagnosed solely on the basis of observ@@ able behavior .
research shows that 50 percent of children , almost 50 percent of children diagnosed with autism are actually suffering from hidden brain seizures .
they don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t come back several times , so it really chronicles a journey .
richard saul wur@@ man : i remember hearing him talk at penn .
louis kahn , yes !
he could not probably give the right kind of love for you , but for us , he has given the people the right kind of love , that is important .
what if they look up at the night sky , at the same stars , but from the opposite side ?
where &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the line that marks that ?
zir@@ cons that are mined in the jack hills of western australia , zir@@ cons taken from the jack hills of western australia tell us that within a few hundred million years of the origin of the planet there was abundant water and perhaps even life .
now drake did not discover extr@@ ater@@ restrial intelligence , but he learned a very valuable lesson from a passing aircraft , and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s that ter@@ restrial technology can interfere with the search for extr@@ ater@@ restrial technology .
so , if that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s right , why did we only capture four out of those 151 minds ?
come with me to the bottom of the world , antarctica , the highest , drie@@ st , win@@ die@@ st , and yes , col@@ dest region on earth -- more ar@@ id than the sahara and , in parts , colder than mars .
but under the surface is a hi@@ ve of industrial activity periodi@@ cally , this drill , like a biop@@ sy needle , plun@@ ges thousands of feet deep into the ice to extract a mar@@ row of gases and iso@@ top@@ es for analysis .
don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t we already know the consequences of a changing climate on our settled civilization ?
the old story about climate protection is that it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s costly , or it would have been done already .
and serious competition from europe , from korea , and next is china , which will soon be a major net exporter of cars .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s finan@@ ceable in the private capital market .
this is not very grati@@ fying after more than a century of devoted engineering effort .
each one is formed by one fairly cheap die set , instead of four expensive ones for stam@@ ping steel .
for example , fe@@ e-@@ bates , a combination of a fee and a rebate in any size class of vehicle you want , can increase the price of in@@ efficient vehicles and correspon@@ dingly pay you a rebate for efficient vehicles .
and make the transition to more efficient vehicles go faster .
there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s six billion dollars on the table .
we launched two titles in october -- &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; rock@@ ett &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s new school &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; -- the first of a series of products -- is about a character called rock@@ ett beginning her first day of school in eighth grade at a brand new place , with a blank slate , which allows girls to play with the question of , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; what will i be like when i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m older ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
girl 6 : like , if you were a girl and you were really adventurous and a real big tom@@ boy , you would think that girls &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; games were kinda si@@ ssy .
bl : i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to fast-@@ forward to the decision point because i know i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t have a lot of time .
brenda laure@@ l : games for girls
i also need alcohol and mor@@ phine , because it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the only way i can work . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
many soci@@ ologists like ve@@ blen and wolfe would argue that the reason why we take origins so seriously is because we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re sno@@ bs , because we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re focused on status .
there are now dozens , perhaps hundreds of studies showing that if you believe you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re drinking the expensive stuff , it tastes better to you .
people have murdered those that they loved , believing that they were murdering an im@@ poster .
then we asked them , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; how much would you pay for george clooney &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s sweater ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
they just don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t like it .
as many of you know , this is the composition where the pianist sits at a bench , opens up the piano and sits and does nothing for four minutes and 33 seconds -- that period of silence .
paul bloom : the origins of pleasure
so what i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to show you is all of the main things , all of the main features of my discipline -- eviden@@ ce-based medicine .
&@@ quo@@ t@@ ; a glass of red wine a day could help prevent breast cancer . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and the claim was fish oil pills improve school performance and behavior in mainstream children .
two sugar pills a day beats one sugar pill a day .
again , not an insane dose , not an illegal dose , but very much at the high end of normal .
so you can see here that the small negative trials that should be on the bottom left have disappeared .
we already have the data showing that it reduces the duration of your flu by a few hours .
and pretty soon , they began shipping that coal , ton by ton , rail car by rail car , boat@@ load by boat@@ load , back to china and elsewhere around the world .
can you imagine what you would feel if you were in my shoes ?
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s all about oil ; you know that , everybody knows that .
there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s this thing , this militari@@ zation of the world , and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s centered right in the united states .
and what do you see ? they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re christians .
and this word here , george bush called this war a crusa@@ de .
you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got to see this -- bible boot camp .
of course , you got it wrong .
and what i want you to do is picture her as a chinese woman receiving a chinese flag because her loved one has died in america in the coal uprising .
can you feel their anger , their fear , their rage at what has happened in their country ?
and suddenly , without realizing it , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re seeing the world differently .
communication walls , i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t have to tell you -- the internet -- have come tum@@ bling down .
more than ever before it is these types of ideas which are driving growth on the cutting edge .
and that means an increase incentive to do research and development , which benefits everyone in the world .
i think of the great indian mathemati@@ cian , ra@@ manu@@ jan .

when i was writing up my notes oil was $ 140 per barrel .
if we were to wipe out insects alone , just that group alone , on this planet -- which we are trying hard to do -- the rest of life and humanity with it would mostly disappear from the land .
60,000 species are known to science , but more than 1.5 million have been estimated to exist .
what will we find as we map the living world , as , finally , we get this underway seriously ?
human-@@ forced climate change alone -- again , if unab@@ ated -- could eliminate a quarter of surviving species during the next five decades .
it makes all key information about life on earth accessible to anyone , on demand , anywhere in the world .

well birds are pretty hard-@@ wired , as it happens , so most of that is already in their dna , but to supplement it , part of ben &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s idea is to use hom@@ ing pi@@ geons to help train the young passenger pi@@ geons how to flock and how to find their way to their old ne@@ sting grounds and feeding grounds .
another interesting project , though it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s going to need some help , is the northern white rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os .

he ran and worked in a factory .
and i liked making that book because i loved using my imagination , and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what writing is .
i drew funny pictures of my teachers -- -- and i passed them around .
i just wanted a video camera .
i set up a studio and i tried to get published .
mrs. al@@ isch cut in front of the line and said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; i taught him how to read . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
i said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; mrs. al@@ isch , how are you ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
when i was visiting my termin@@ ally ill father in a hospital , i was asking myself , how does anybody get well in a place that sounds like this ?
this is affected massively by reverber@@ ation time , how reverber@@ ant a room is .

but the teachers came to me afterward and told me they hadn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t seen the kids that atten@@ tive .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s motion and emotion .
in the netherlands -- where i come from -- you actually never see a pig , which is really strange , because , on a population of 16 million people , we have 12 million pigs .
and in cheese@@ cake and all kinds of desserts , like chocolate mou@@ sse , ti@@ ra@@ mis@@ u , vanilla pudding , everything that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s cooled in the supermarket , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s ge@@ latin to make it look good .

will you like all your children ? of course not .
now , this is one model of how language comes to be : namely , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s legi@@ slated by an academy .
a handy thing to have , because language is infinite , and you can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t just par@@ rot back the sentences that you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve heard .
you can think of this as the language of thought , or &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; ment@@ ale@@ se . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
now , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m sure most of you have seen the movie &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; fargo . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
in dating , the transition from friendship to sex can lead to , notoriously , various forms of awkwar@@ dness , and as can sex in the workplace , in which we call the conflict between a dominant and a sexual relationship &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; sexual harassment . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
so you get the best of both worlds .
i tend to win those arguments , because i know the tricks .
so we have these models -- argument as war , argument as proof , and argument as performance .
oh , and one more thing , and as an educator , this is the one that really bo@@ thers me : if argument is war , then there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s an impli@@ cit equation of learning with losing .
what we need is new exit strategies for arguments .
why do we argue ? to out-@@ reason our opponents , prove them wrong , and , most of all , to win ! ... right ? philosopher daniel h. cohen shows how our most common form of argument -- a war in which one person must win and the other must lose -- misses out on the real benefits of engaging in active disagreement . &@@ amp@@ ; lt ; em &@@ amp@@ ; gt ; &@@ amp@@ ; lt ; / em &@@ amp@@ ; gt ;
this is learning something , learning an idea , from an organis@@ m and then applying it .
learning about the natural world is one thing ; learning from the natural world -- that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the switch .
life can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t afford to do that . how does life make things ?
imagine making all of our hard materials that way .
power of shape : here &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a whale . we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve seen that the fin@@ s of this whale have tuber@@ cles on them . and those little bumps actually increase efficiency in , for instance , the edge of an airplane -- increase efficiency by about 32 percent .
and we use all of them , even the toxic ones .
ok , so that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the healing one .
and in ways both big and small , the narrative of the victim shapes the way we see women .
why are you so passionate ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
micro@@ finance is an incredibly powerful tool that leads to self-@@ suffici@@ ency and self-@@ respect , but we must move beyond micro-@@ hopes and micro-@@ ambitions for women , because they have so much greater hopes for themselves .
you know why ?
and when i was applying to business school and felt certain i couldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t do it and nobody i knew had done it , i went to my aunt who survived years of beat@@ ings at the hand of her husband and escaped a marriage of abuse with only her dignity intact .
but it was a little bit boring .
but the way that humans tell the stories has always evolved with pure , consistent novelty .
and now all bets are off .
and yet , all the press is focused on that .
about 10 years ago , i was at a cocktail party with a friend of mine , and we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re sitting there , and he was complaining about the cro@@ ws that he had seen that were all over his yard and making a big mess .
and in all that area , they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re only rarely found breeding more than five kilometers away from human beings .
so , it turns out we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve been finding more and more that cro@@ ws are really , really intelligent .
in fact , that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s old hat for cro@@ ws .
so , when they get really used to that , we move on to the cro@@ ws coming back .
i think that cro@@ ws can be trained to do other things .
so the management of electro@@ lux took our pile , our list of incentives , and they went outside the room for 17 minutes , and they came back in and they said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; wow , this is the most generous any community has ever been to try to keep jobs here .
as we know , only half the states have opted in .
every region has something to offer , and if you created a competition , it respects the states and it respects feder@@ alism .
if you hadn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t noticed , our media climate generally provides a very distorted mirror of our lives and of our gender , and i think that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s going to change .
when they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re monitoring your cli@@ ck@@ stream -- and you know they are -- they have a really hard time figuring out your age , your gender and your income .
the future entertainment media that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to see is going to be very data-@@ driven , and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s going to be based on the information that we as@@ certain from taste communities online , where women are really driving the action .
up goes the bird , out come the words , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; ju@@ an@@ ito , ju@@ an@@ ito , ven@@ te a comer mi hi@@ jo ! &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
you might wanna avert your gaze , because that is a new@@ t about to re@@ generate its lim@@ b , and shaking hands spreads more ger@@ ms than kissing .
okay . now on the left you can see the hand -- that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the big arrow -- and the penis on the right . the hand hovering .
and i said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; so , could you do it right here ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
i actually suggested to -- there is a researcher at the university of alabama who does orgas@@ m research .
doctors back then were routinely telling men the importance of pleas@@ uring their wives .
british sex@@ ologist roy levin has speculated that this is perhaps why men evolved to be such enthusiastic and frequent ma@@ stur@@ bat@@ ors .
and i said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; so why don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t you just stimulate the cli@@ tor@@ is of the pig ?
and the woman would have sex with it .
and yet , despite everything going really well for john , he was struggling , fighting addiction and a gripping depression .
now i know that seems ludicrous .
pull the knot .
and it seemed to me even he felt really bad facing these un@@ organized red squares day after day .
we are only happy when things are in order .
so we can also see that very clearly in this next painting .
and i think the whole thing adds up much better if you do it like this .
but after a while , i just decided here to go all the way and put the paint back into the cans .
and i started to bring some order into some flags .
he had a di@@ xi@@ eland jazz band when we were growing up , and he would always cover louis armstrong tunes .
and moms grab their kids out of the way and say , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t stare ! &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s right , that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s right ; i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m no longer a victim .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s as though intent is an essential component for humanity .
in fact , maybe that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the problem .
they were trying to answer the question of what would human beings do now that they were no longer simply trying to survive ?
i was in a wheelchair ; i didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t look like a loo@@ ter .
this is what we must demand of our lives , of our objects , of our things , of our circumstances : living with intent .
i didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t have an exact address , but i knew his name , a@@ bed , i knew that he lived in a town of 15,000 , k@@ far kara , and i knew that , 21 years before , just outside this holy city , he broke my neck .
but a@@ bed did not slow , and on that x@@ ero@@ xed piece of paper , my neck again broke , and again , i was left without anger .
were all of us the results of things done to us , done for us , the in@@ fidelity of a parent or spouse , money inherited ?
and as i sat contemplating what to say , a woman approached in a black sha@@ wl and black robe .
no , i was quiet . i was quiet because i had not come for truth .
&@@ quo@@ t@@ ; um , a@@ bed , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; i said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; i thought you had a few driving issues before the crash . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
yes , contrast .
i built the head . they built the body .
and it sees multiple people in a scene , remembers where individual people are , and looks from person to person , remembering people .
someone invited me to a meeting , but couldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t manage to fit me in to a regular sort of conference room meeting , and said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; i have to walk my dogs tomorrow . could you come then ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and i did a little calculation of this .
for example , dan pink &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s talk on motivation , which was pretty good if you haven &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t seen it : &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; drop carrot . drop stick . bring meaning . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
they used their six words to talk back to me and ask me if i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d been too much on google lately .
and i would only pay $ 9@@ 9.@@ 50 -- so stay even below a hundred dollars for it .
okay , part one starts back in 1929 when the great astron@@ omer edwin hubble realized that the distant galaxies were all rushing away from us , establishing that space itself is stretching , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s expanding .
expressed in the relevant unit , it is spectac@@ ul@@ arly small .
so parti@@ cle masses , the strengths of forces , and most importantly , the amount of dark energy would be determined by the shape of the extra dimensions .
and in those univer@@ ses that have much less dark energy , well they collapse back on themselves so quickly that , again , galaxies don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t form .
because such a mechanism has been found by co@@ sm@@ ologists trying to understand the big bang .
you see , we learned that our universe is not static , that space is expanding , that that expansion is speeding up and that there might be other univer@@ ses all by carefully examining faint pin@@ points of star@@ light coming to us from distant galaxies .
we can understand how to understand the data from the microwave background radiation that was set down 13.@@ 72 billion years ago -- and yet , we can do calculations today to predict how it will look and it matches .
you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to meet mil@@ o for the first time .
you can lean back , but the camera will change its perspective depending on which way you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re looking .
mil@@ o : i wonder how deep it is .
now , to do that , we needed a set up , like a magi@@ cian &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s trick .
you cleaned up my room .
and suddenly she sees a tank amb@@ ling down the main road of sar@@ aje@@ vo knocking everything out of its path .
i believe a story there has to be told .
and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s pretty much why i do it .
and all i can really do is hope , not to policymakers or politicians , because as much as i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d like to have faith that they read my words and do something , i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t delu@@ de myself .
and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s exactly what we did 10 years ago .
just fast forward 10 years .
as fast as we can reset our computers , the brain activity shifts to start representing this new tool , as if this too was a part of that pri@@ mate &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s body .
and i was five years old , and i never understood why nasa didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t hire captain kirk and spo@@ ck to do the job ; after all , they were very profi@@ ci@@ ent -- but just seeing that as a kid made me believe , as my grandmother used to tell me , that &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; impossible is just the possible that someone has not put in enough effort to make it come true . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
why would we waste this money on you ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and that brings me to my first major of two ten@@ ets of &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; half the sky . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
in india , in the first year of life , from zero to one , boy and girl babies basically survive at the same rate because they depend upon the breast , and the breast shows no son preference .
so what would some of the specific challenges look like ?
so that meant she was in@@ continent ; she couldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t control her wa@@ stes .
well , when she had her second daughter , her mother in-law told her son , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; i think you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d better get a second wife .
the twins started producing milk .
we also think that individuals can make a difference , and they should , because individuals , together , we can all help create a movement .
sher@@ yl wu@@ dunn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s book &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; half the sky &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; investigates the oppression of women globally . her stories shock . only when women in developing countries have equal access to education and economic opportunity will we be using all our human resources .
why not ? i mean , that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what we do .
and this cumulative cultural adaptation , as anthrop@@ ologists call this accu@@ mulation of ideas , is responsible for everything around you in your bustling and te@@ em@@ ing everyday lives .
the other option we could choose was to develop the systems of communication that would allow us to share ideas and to cooperate amongst others .
and this is why our species has prosper@@ ed around the world while the rest of the animals sit behind bars in zoos , lan@@ guishing .
and this is also true of some remote oce@@ anic islands .
to put it this way , nature knows no other circumstance in which fun@@ c@@ tionally equivalent traits co@@ exist .
biologist mark pa@@ gel shares an intriguing theory about why humans evolved our complex system of language . he suggests that language is a piece of &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; social technology &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; that allowed early human tribes to access a powerful new tool : cooperation .
and what i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m most interested in is the invisible space between a text and its accompanying image , and how the image is transformed by the text and the text by the image .
this is the only feder@@ ally funded site where it is legal to cultiv@@ ate cannabis for scientific research in the united states .
this is the death star .
for the men in these photographs , the primary cause of their wrongful conviction was mistaken identification .
he ended up serving 18 and a half years of an 80 year sentence for rape and robbery .
last year alone , 99 feder@@ ally declared disasters were on file with fe@@ ma , from j@@ op@@ lin , missouri , and tu@@ sc@@ alo@@ osa , alabama , to the central texas wildfires that just happened recently .
so the first idea i had , initially , was just to go the federal and state governments and go , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; here , take it , for free . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
our school would show bill n@@ ye the science guy .
we have dawn or@@ biting ve@@ sta , and we have over here new horizons on a straight shot to plu@@ to .
there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a point to be made here .
so given that that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s true , how good are we at increasing our happiness ?
we also find that people are more a@@ verse to losing than they are happy to gain .
so when people &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s symptoms go away , they tend to rec@@ ur , because there isn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t a sense of the other half -- of what pleasure , happiness , compassion , gratitude , what are the positive emotions .
it wouldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t eat . it wouldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t sleep . it wouldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t have sex .
and even studies of cooperation show that cooperation between individuals lights up reward centers of the brain .
i seize command by physical prowess , and i keep it by beating my chest , and you make sub@@ missive gestures .
i end with a few quotes .
why would you choose rats ?
once the animal knows click , food , click , food , click , food -- so click is food -- we bring it in a cage with a hole , and actually the animal learns to stick the nose in the hole under which a target scent is placed , and to do that for five seconds -- five seconds , which is long for a rat .
it means that , if you have t.@@ b. , you have more chance that you won &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t be detected , but will just die from t.@@ b. secondary infections and so on .
and by just presenting the samples once more to the rats and lo@@ oping those results back , we were able to increase case detection rates by over 30 percent .
and this is truly the most amazing thing in the world .
now , what is the significance of these mirror neurons ?
in other words , if somebody touches me , my hand , neur@@ on in the som@@ ato@@ sensory corte@@ x in the sensory region of the brain fires .
it emerges from our understanding of basic neuro@@ science .
so , that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s 20 micro@@ meters across , that pollen grain there .
this is a bee &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s leg with the pollen gl@@ om@@ med onto it from a mal@@ low plant .
four very different habitats might look similar , but they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got very different pollen signatures .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s certainly what i learned when i was training .
we have effective therapies now .
and she started , the women &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s health initiative .
some women have those heart attacks , but a whole bunch of women have this kind of heart attack , where it ero@@ des , doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t completely fill with clo@@ t , symptoms are subtle , ek@@ g findings are different -- fe@@ male-@@ pattern .
now what are the implications of that ?
and those little red boxes are deaths .
we still have two to three more women dying for every man .
so if we can be as good as breast cancer and give women this new charge , we have a lot of lives to save .
we copy this in the lab by out@@ fitting cell culture systems with electro@@ des .
and in the case of the flora in our gut , these cells may not even be human .
but there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s also a scientific reason that drove this project , which was to use this natural long@@ itu@@ din@@ al data to understand the process of how a child learns language -- that child being my son .
the way to interpret this apparently simple graph is , on the vertical is an indication of how complex caregi@@ ver utter@@ ances are based on the length of utter@@ ances .
now we freeze the action , 30 minutes , we turn time into the vertical axis , and we open up for a view of these interaction traces we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve just left behind .
this has become my favorite way of video@@ graph@@ ing just about any space .
and there are , again , now tens of millions of these links that give us the conne@@ ctive tissue of social graph@@ s and how they relate to content .
and then i went on to reflect , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; isn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t it amazing , this entire database , all these recordings , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to hand off to you and to your sister &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; -- who arrived two years later -- &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; and you guys are going to be able to go back and re-@@ experience moments that you could never , with your biological memory , possibly remember the way you can now ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
mit researcher deb roy wanted to understand how his infant son learned language -- so he wired up his house with video@@ cameras to catch every moment of his son &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s life , then par@@ sed 90,000 hours of home video to watch &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; ga@@ aaa &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; slowly turn into &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; water . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; astonishing , data-@@ rich research with deep implications for how we learn .
a second part of the brain is called the dor@@ sal stream .
we make meaning by seeing , by an act of visual interrogation .
secondly , making them interactive .
this is a laundry ch@@ ute , and this right here is a shoe last .
but i get a lot of toilets , and so you just dispatch a toilet with a hammer , and then you have lu@@ mpy tiles .
but you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve never seen this one before .
and in there he said that cultures tend to swing between one of two perspectives .
and so if something isn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t standard , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; o@@ ops , dump@@ ster . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; o@@ ops &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; this . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; o@@ ops , war@@ ped . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
the problem is we can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t afford it .
all we have to do is look at what one company did with carbon@@ ated pr@@ une juice .
that exacerb@@ ates and continues this model .
that is , our housing has become a commodity .
in this funny and insi@@ ghtful talk , builder dan phillips tours us through a dozen homes he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s built in texas using recycled and reclaim@@ ed materials in wildly creative ways . brilliant , low-@@ tech design details will refresh your own creative drive . &@@ amp@@ ; lt ; em &@@ amp@@ ; gt ; &@@ amp@@ ; lt ; / em &@@ amp@@ ; gt ;
and the reason i think it would be so interesting to you is because consciousness is so interesting .
there is no more drastic and sudden gap created between potential and actual mind than a severe head injury .
but if you look into the eye of consciousness , that single eye you can see , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m looking down , but let me tell you how i felt at that point .
the global perspective is that up to 30 percent of children in school have learning weaknesses that are not self-@@ correc@@ ting , but with appropriate treatment , they can be screened for and detected and corrected and avoid their academic failure .
the answer is yes , and for the first time , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s my pleasure to be able to share two examples .
imagine the blood flowing through your body -- i was told at ucla medical center -- as one sealed system .
so it goes in and it stays there .
and so i was sitting in this restaurant , waiting for a man to come by who obviously would have some difficulty ...
and if you walk faster , if i walk faster , it dete@@ cts what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s called the time interval , which is the interval between each heel lift .
and i started in our medical university , karol@@ in@@ ska institute , an undergraduate course called global health . but when you get that opportunity , you get a little nervous . i thought , these students coming to us actually have the highest grade you can get in swedish college systems -- so , i thought , maybe they know everything i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to teach them about . so i did a pre-@@ test when they came .
now what has happened since 1962 ? we want to see the change .
where are the different countries ? i can show you africa .
yemen , civil war . united arab emirate , money which was quite equally and well used .
everything in this world exists in africa . and you can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t discuss universal access to hiv &@@ #@@ 9@@ 1@@ ; medicine &@@ #@@ 93@@ ; for that qu@@ inti@@ le up here with the same strategy as down here . the improvement of the world must be highly con@@ tex@@ tu@@ alized , and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not relevant to have it on regional level . we must be much more detailed .
and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a quite clever guy , hu@@ h ?
but it slightly bor@@ es me .
so i had a really quite happy life at indiana .
and certainly , neither cri@@ ck or i were chemi@@ sts , so we tried to build a model . and he knew , francis knew wil@@ kins .
and i read it , and it was just -- it was crap .
and we knew we were right .
but that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the only -- no , we were only photographed twice .
so , we started with breast cancer because there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s lots of money for it , no government money .
were they crazy also , and we didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t know it ?
you need to know that the average patent troll defense costs two million dollars and takes 18 months when you win .
now what did i learn from this case ? well , three things .
be@@ hold , patent infrin@@ gement via mobile device -- defined as a computer which is not station@@ ary .
it was a huge success .
they laughed together .
now i bet , in this audience , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re thinking of some really incredible technology , some stuff that i haven &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t even heard of , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m absolutely sure .
bruce a@@ yl@@ ward : o@@ ops . jon , polio &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s almost been eradi@@ cated .
so what we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re looking for is a permanent solution .
it deterior@@ ates so quickly in the tropi@@ cs that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve had to put this special vaccine monitor on every single vial so that it will change very quickly when it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s exposed to too much heat , and we can tell that it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not a good vaccine to use on a child -- it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not potent ; it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not going to protect them .
within a couple of years , every country that started polio eradi@@ cation rapidly eradi@@ cated all three of their polio viruses , with the exception of four countries that you see here .
he lives in a family home there with his eight brothers and sisters .
and this started an incredible collaboration with industry , and within six months , we were testing a new polio vaccine that targeted , just two years ago , the last two types of polio in the world .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s ready to reach them with bed nets , with other things .
and is it easy to raise that money ?
and she took us on a journey and revealed something very special to us -- her own daughter , eight days old .
dj : now one of the big things , of course , everybody knows that cats hate water , and so this was a real revelation for us .
b@@ j : so , as der@@ eck says , we have to work through extremes -- extreme temperatures , push ourselves at night .
it was phenomenal , and we felt grateful that she trusted us to that extent .
but i have to tell you -- everybody always asks , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; what happened to the baby bab@@ oon ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s probably because we haven &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t seen it like we are today .
my title : &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; que@@ erer than we can suppose : the stran@@ gen@@ ess of science . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
science has taught us , against all intu@@ ition , that apparently solid things , like crystals and rocks , are really almost entirely composed of empty space .
if we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d evolved in a vacuum , we would expect them to hit the ground simultaneously . if we were bacteria , constantly buffe@@ ted by thermal movements of molecules , it would be different , but we middle worl@@ ders are too big to notice brow@@ nian motion .
what we see of the real world is not the un@@ var@@ nished world but a model of the world , regulated and adjusted by sense data , but constructed so it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s useful for dealing with the real world .
mira@@ cles are just events that are extremely impro@@ bable .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d be different , our characters would be different , if our neuro@@ -@@ anatomy and our physi@@ ological chemistry were different .
i went to notre dame university and graduated with degrees in accounting and german , including spending a year of study in austria .
all of us have disabilities in one form or another .
can you show us how good of a pilot you are ?
moving on from this , the next person to explore this field was a gentleman called hans jenny in the 1970s .
then on the right we can see a cym@@ atically created snow@@ fla@@ ke .
their pictures became part of our collective consciousness and , as consciousness evolved into a shared sense of conscience , change became not only possible , but inevitable .
and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s terribly endangered .
and you don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t necessarily have the sense that twitter is in fact a very heavily brazilian space .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the economy of moving these heavy , slow atom@@ s over long distances that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s very difficult to do .
you start looking at how the global plane flights move , and you suddenly discover that the world isn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t even close to flat .
when you look at the new york times , you look at other elite media , what you largely get are pictures of very wealthy nations and the nations we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve invaded .
nor do i think we are by ourselves , actually going to solve the problem .
there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a group right now in china called ye@@ ey@@ an .
not only does she have to keep our israeli and palestinian contributors from killing each other , she has to figure out what is going to interest you about the middle east .
he knows one world , and he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s finding a way to communicate it to another world , both of which he has deep connections to .
we have to fix our immigration policy .
in afghanistan , for example , we haven &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t just had one election or two elections . we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve gone through three elections , presidential and parliamentary . and what do we find ?
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not that it guarantees peace with itself or with its neighbors .
the public is losing faith in democracy , says british mp rory stewart . iraq and afghanistan &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s new democracies are deeply corrupt ; meanwhile , 84 percent of people in britain say politics is broken . in this important talk , stewart sounds a call to action to rebuild democracy , starting with recognizing why democracy is important -- not as a tool , but as an ideal .
the short answer is , actually , they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re from japan .
this is a billboard that says : &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; welcome to the birth@@ place of general t@@ so . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s go back to mid-@@ 18@@ 00s when the chinese first came to america .
for example , there is french chinese food , where they serve salt and pepper frog legs .
so , like , ok , maybe it had to do with the patterns on the little pieces of paper -- you know , like , it was a diamond , or , you know , diag@@ onal .
so me , general t@@ so &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s chicken and this logo are all kar@@ mac@@ ally related .
finally , in about the six@@ teenth century , a physician whose name was the@@ op@@ h@@ rast@@ us bom@@ bast@@ us au@@ re@@ ol@@ us von hohen@@ heim , called par@@ ac@@ el@@ sus , a name probably familiar to some people here -- -- good , old par@@ ac@@ el@@ sus found that he could predict the degree of con@@ vul@@ sion by using a measured amount of cam@@ ph@@ or to produce the con@@ vul@@ sion .
he re@@ lap@@ sed a little bit , they gave him a series of treatments , and he was essentially cured .
it had to do with being brought up in a family where no one spoke english , no one could read or write english .
and they tried everything they had .
well , he said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t we try a course of electro@@ shock therapy ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and things got better and better , and within three or four months , i was discharged from that hospital , and i joined a group of surgeons where i could work with other people in the community , not in new haven , but fairly close by .
so one of the reasons that i have come here to talk about this today is to -- frankly , sel@@ fi@@ shly -- un@@ burden myself and let it be known that this is not an un@@ troubled mind that has written all of these books .
i believe the concept of global citizenship will simply grow out of people talking to each other across continents .
now , what is remarkable is that civil rights in america were achieved in the 1960s .
but i think this is the frustration that perhaps a lot people have , like people in the audience here , where we love the kind of language that you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re talking about .
and we have had a speaker who said that very thing , and swal@@ lowed a sword right after that , which was quite dramatic .
i mean , the great difficulty in europe is if you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re at a meeting and 27 people speak , it takes a very very long time .
and then the secretary general of the united nations &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; when will our international institutions work ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
so the question is , how do you rein@@ vent something that has been around for five millen@@ nia ?
and the most remarkable feat is that my hand actually stayed still long enough to do that .
and you see here a picture of a tissue section .
some of the greatest innovations and developments in the world often happen at the intersection of two fields .
if you don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t like the subject or the performance , you can hold the red .
data : a couple of new jersey hunters are out in the woods .
so this is actually the first time we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve ever done live audience feedback to a performance .
what can we do together that benefits us both ?
stran@@ gen@@ ess is that cali@@ br@@ ation of clo@@ sen@@ ess and distance that enables me to find the people that i need right now , that enables me to find the sources of intimacy , of discovery , and of inspiration that i need right now .
it all began for him during world war ii , when at age 17 he found himself thrust into a forged documents workshop .
i was born in algeria .
so at the age of 14 my father had to work .
but it was only the beginning .
he also explained to me that i had a brother , too , and the first time i saw them i must have been three or four , and they were 30 years older than me .
europe was not spared either .
this is bad news , but perhaps surprising to you , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s also part of the good news .
never have we seen , in the past 50 years , such a sharp decline of ecosystem functions and services on the planet , one of them being the ability to regulate climate on the long term , in our forests , land and biodiversity .
as a sideline , you know that the only red flag that popped up here was a submarine from an unnamed country that planted a red flag at the bottom of the arctic to be able to control the oil resources .
what you see here in black line is the safe operating space , the quanti@@ fied boundaries , as suggested by this analysis .
under the realization from tourist operators , fishermen , the australian great barrier reef authority and scientists that the great barrier reef is doomed under the current governance regime .
the key though in all of these , the red thread , is the shift in mindset , moving away from a situation where we simply are pushing ourselves into a dark future , where we instead back@@ cast our future , and we say , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; what is the playing field on the planet ?
though it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s actually true , you know , the reason i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m talking to you right now is because i was born in brazil .
but i wasn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t into selling whiskey ; i was into selling ice .
&@@ quo@@ t@@ ; the sna@@ il . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
this is &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; 6,@@ 500 yards , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; after cor@@ ot . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; 9,000 yards , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; after gerhard richter .
they do a dna scan of this , they will come up with a great mailing list .
a hanger .
and we can then see the result of such mutations when we compare dna sequences among us here in the room , for example .
and later , between 100 and 50,000 years ago or so , went out of africa to coloni@@ ze the rest of the world .
there is another thing with those traits that we so easily observe in each other that i think is worthwhile to consider , and that is that , in a very literal sense , they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re really on the surface of our bodies .
statisti@@ cally speaking , there is no difference in how often the neander@@ thal matches one african or the other .
they meet neander@@ th@@ als , mix with them , continue to spread over the world , and somewhere in southeast asia , they meet deni@@ so@@ vans and mix with them and continue on out into the pacific .
so sustainability is quite important for us , which should incorporate social but as well as environmental and economic values .
so let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s compare the old world with the new world .
we have social areas inside the aircraft which might turn into a place where you can play virtual golf .
these are survival skills .
this is our body wisdom . it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not something that is medi@@ ated by our language . our body just knows that , and we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve known that for a long time .
there are millions of individuals with autism all around us .
well , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s hard to do that , so we had to create the technologies . we had to basically step inside a body .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s almost as if that stimulus , you , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re not exer@@ ting influence on what happens as they navigate their daily lives .
early diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder can improve the lives of everyone affected , but the complex network of causes make it incredibly difficult to predict . at ted@@ x@@ pe@@ ach@@ tree , ami klin describes a new early detection method that uses eye-@@ tracking technologies to gauge babies &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; social engagement skills and reliably measure their risk of developing autism . &@@ amp@@ ; lt ; em &@@ amp@@ ; gt ; &@@ amp@@ ; lt ; / em &@@ amp@@ ; gt ;
if you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re an out@@ board personnel , now you stand up .
you are going to hit the ground .
i was raised with traditional stories of leadership : robert e. lee , john bu@@ ford at gett@@ y@@ sburg .
more importantly , the force that i led was spread over more than 20 countries .
i asked , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; where were you on 9 / 11 ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
i learned they are the sin@@ ew which hold the force together .
and if you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re a leader , the people who count on you need you on your feet .
she then assigned these works racial identities , basically saying to me that the work on the right , clearly , was made by a black artist , the work on the left , clearly , by a white artist , when , in effect , that was the opposite case : bob col@@ es@@ cott , african-@@ american artist ; leon gol@@ u@@ b , a white artist .
what that might mean for cultural movements all over this moment , the &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; me , we &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; seems incredibly pres@@ ci@@ ent totally important .
so , what do i discover when i look at artworks ?
they downloaded it from disney@@ .com , or one of these websites , 14 days after putting the computer in their village .
this is a 15 year-old boy .
i called in 26 children .
but 30 percent is not a pass .
i gave them six gc@@ se questions .
you can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t catch me .
they ty@@ ped it into google , translated it into italian , went back into italian google .

the next moment , as soon as they finished and disappeared into the shadows , a young man with a pro@@ pan@@ e lan@@ tern came on , hung it up on a tree , set up a curtain .
i love the apparent truth of theater .
ariel : i boarded the king &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s ship . in every cabin , i fla@@ med amaz@@ ement .
and as she was there on the edge of that stage , two stage@@ hands all in black with watering cans ran along the top and started to pour water on the sand castle , and the sand castle started to drip and sink , but before it did , the audience saw the black-@@ clad stage@@ hands .
what the hell are we doing up there on that stage ?
julie ta@@ ym@@ or : spider-man , the lion king and life on the creative edge
you choose . it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s your bakery , your street , your country -- not mine . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and so , on a micro level , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a real role for this combination of investment and philanthropy .
and i really understood what patient capital meant emotionally in the last month or so . because the company was literally 10 days away from proving that the product they produced was at the world-@@ quality level needed to make co@@ ar@@ tem , when they were in the biggest cash crisis of their history .
in our first year , the first net went off the line in october of 2003 .
she was very much like those women sitting behind the sewing machines .
now , when we first started talking to ok go -- the name of the song is &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; this too shall pass &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; -- we were really excited because they expressed interest in building a machine that they could dance with .
the machine itself would start the music .
it doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t matter what temperature it is , doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t matter what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s in its way ; it will pretty much get where it needs to go .
and now to introduce their music video , we have ok go .
and so we built some very sophisticated radio anten@@ nas just for probing both walls and searching for an air gap .
so we thought of an augmented reality application using a tablet . let me show you just simu@@ lating what we could be doing , any of us could be doing , in a museum environment .
and the later it fails , the worse the consequences .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a disease that runs in my family , and we really hope that cells like these will help us find a cure .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve tried to show in this -- though the color doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t come out -- that what i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m concerned with is the little 50-@@ year time bubble that you are in . you tend to be interested in a generation past , a generation future -- your parents , your kids , things you can change over the next few decades -- and this 50-@@ year time bubble you kind of move along in . and in that 50 years , if you look at the population curve , you find the population of humans on the earth more than doubles and we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re up three-@@ and-a-half times since i was born . when you have a new baby , by the time that kid gets out of high school more people will be added than existed on earth when i was born .
your great-@@ great grandparents got by on muscle power , and yet we all think there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s this huge power that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s essential for our lifestyle . and with all the wonderful technology we have we can do things that are much more efficient : conserve , recycle , etc .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s part of a long-term program nasa sponsored .
all right .
well , inspired by the sentences , i decided to wi@@ eld the pain@@ t@@ brush .
thank you .
&@@ quo@@ t@@ ; it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d be like putting a piece of toast through a basketball ho@@ op , wouldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t it ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
over thousands of years ago , he proved that for us .
he proved it was prime with nothing more than a qu@@ ill , ink , paper and his mind .
it took him , by his estimate , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; three years of sundays . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s because of curtis cooper that we know , currently the largest prime number we know , is 2 ^ 5@@ 7,@@ 88@@ 5,@@ 161 .
we live in an age where some of the great break@@ through@@ s are not going to happen in the labs or the halls of academia but on laptops , desk@@ tops , in the pal@@ ms of people &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s hands who are simply helping out for the search .
and what was so gorgeous about this discovery was 50 years ago peter hi@@ ggs and his team considered one of the deepest of all questions : how is it that the things that make us up have no mass ?
in fact , growing up in tasmania , it always was incredibly exciting when we got a chance to see a tas@@ man@@ ian devil in the wild .
scientists around the world were intrigued by this cancer , this infectious cancer , that was spreading through the tas@@ man@@ ian devil population .
he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a tas@@ man@@ ian devil that we found with a large tumor on his face .
he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a dog that belongs to a family in mom@@ bas@@ a in kenya .
however , under some circumstances , it can happen .
so if we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re married , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re more likely to have kids .
so most of us put ourselves above average on most of these abilities .
number two : regardless of the outcome , the pure act of anticipation makes us happy .
so they tend to expect the future to be worse than it ends up being .
but if someone started off saying , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; my average likelihood of suffering from cancer is about 10 percent , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; and we said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; hey , bad news .
and what he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s doing is he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s passing a small magnetic pulse through the skull of the participant in our study into their infer@@ ior frontal gy@@ rus .
and i believe there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a way for us to do that .
it really should be called the recovery or return of asia .
but think of what it does to how we think in traditional terms and concepts .
the te@@ ct@@ onic plates of world politics were shifting .
you know , it looks at economic power measured by gdp .
and as i said earlier , china has not passed the united states .
now i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t mean to be pol@@ ly@@ anna@@ ish about this .
in fact , they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve accounted for half of all civil wars .
and why is it so difficult initially ?
so the donors have to stick with this situation for at least a decade .
and indeed , unfortunately , if you navigate by needs you get a very un@@ focused agenda , because in these situations , needs are everywhere , but the capacity to implement change is very limited .
there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s one sector which isn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t exposed to international trade , and which can generate a lot of jobs , and which is , in any case , a sensible sector to expand , post-@@ conflict , and that is the construction sector .
the planning function and policy function stays with the ministry ; the delivery of services on the ground , you should use whatever works -- churches , ngos , local communities , whatever works .
what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the goal ?
there are important distri@@ bu@@ tional consequences , and they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re not what you always might think .
we need better planning and systems for evacuation .
it makes sense , right ? there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s open space , the planes can take off and land without worrying about creating noise or avoiding tall buildings .
there are no quick fixes .
t : most importantly ... s : most importantly ...
j@@ w : so is english mania good or bad ?
now this has raised all sorts of questions .
and he asked that particular person , what do cro@@ ws and fish have in common ?
they weren &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t willing to engage in this .
well , in 1900 , three percent of americans practiced professi@@ ons that were cogn@@ itively demanding .
now over the last century , in developed nations like america , moral debate has escalated because we take the hypothetical seriously , and we also take univers@@ als seriously and look for logical connections .
you have to say , well , black@@ ness of skin , you couldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t suffer just for that .
one of the ways in which we would like to deal with the sophisti@@ cation of the modern world is through politics , and sadly you can have humane moral principles , you can classi@@ fy , you can use logic on abstra@@ ctions , and if you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re ignorant of history and of other countries , you can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t do politics .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m a public school teacher , and i just want to share a story of my superintendent .
it could have been denti@@ stry , but the word &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; experimental &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; was in it , and so that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what i had to go for .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a story that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a testament to teaching and teachers .
and so that gesture of my mother &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s continues through many generations .
i offer them the job , they can turn it down , and then they choose their own cabinet .
see , mr. hunter is doing that because he says his time has me@@ ssed up a lot , and he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s trying to tell us how to fix that problem .
this is the world peace game . what is wrong with you ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
&@@ quo@@ t@@ ; let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s ask that mom to read the letter .
this is about my friend brennan .
he rings the bell again . he says , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; we have &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; -- and there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s 12 seconds left on the clock -- &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; we have , all nations , po@@ oled all our funds together .
in india , we had the na@@ x@@ al@@ ite movement , the &@@ #@@ 9@@ 1@@ ; unclear &@@ #@@ 93@@ ; movement .
when you pump in air in a bicycle , you use a bit of this .
they always make a tri@@ an@@ gular roof .
now this is a little pump with which you could infl@@ ate a balloon .
but this is great fun for children .
i just put this inside this .
they are fu@@ sed together , so you can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t separate them .
there are no pat@@ ents . anyone can make it .
this is called &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; the captain &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s hat story . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and the ship sin@@ ks , and the captain has lost everything , but for a life jacket .
so i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to talk about some projects that have explored these ideas .
the way we tend to use resources is we extract them , we turn them into short-@@ life products and then disp@@ ose of them .
and we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d also have a coffee shop , and the waste grains from that could be used as a sub@@ str@@ ate for growing mushrooms .
so amazing example of an adaptation to a very re@@ sour@@ ce-@@ constrained environment -- and in that sense , very relevant to the kind of challenges we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to be facing over the next few years , next few decades .
so this is how this scheme would look .
they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re not just possible ; they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re critical .
and if i want to start having children by the time i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m 35 , that meant that i would have had to have been on my way to marriage five years ago .
now , there was one small catch .
and they say to me , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; stop complaining . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
for me , the hob@@ bies that i have are really just new work projects that i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve launched .
she said she is &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; silly , nice and friendly . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
remember , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m somebody who said that i speak fluent japanese and i know ja@@ vas@@ cri@@ pt and i was okay with that .
obviously , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m having a fabulous life , so -- -- the question is , what does all of this mean for you ?
i know most of you have had the experience of coming back home and finding your kids playing these kinds of games .
imagine you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re driving in a fog . that makes a difference between seeing the car in front of you and avoiding the accident , or getting into an accident .
but a few kids are sad and blue because they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve forgotten their coat .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a multi@@ media-@@ tas@@ ker .
so let me illustrate that step with a task which is called mental rotation .
dap@@ hne ba@@ ve@@ lier : your brain on video games
you get something a little bit more complicated .
well , this has deep implications about the limits of science , about predi@@ ct@@ ability and contro@@ ll@@ ability of things like biological processes or economies , about intelligence in the universe , about questions like free will and about creating technology .
so let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s try asking a question , like a health related question .
so , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m pretty pleased with it all .
then , the idea is that wolfram alpha will be able to figure out what precise pieces of code can do what they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re asking for and then show them examples that will let them pick what they need to build up bigger and bigger , precise programs .
but in at least a large class of cases , one can think of the universe as being like some kind of network , which , when it gets big enough , beha@@ ves like continuous space in much the same way as having lots of molecules can behave like a continuous fluid .
that was astonishing .
there are very few doctors and , quite frankly , these countries do not have the resources that are needed to cope with such epidemi@@ cs .
and this is only done in four hours , 50 times faster than the current state of the art , at a cost that will be five to 500 times cheaper than the current options .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s because my mother was denied an education , and she constantly reminded me and my siblings that she never wanted us to live the life she was living .
well , my dream of becoming a teacher will not come to pass .
i was lucky because one , also , my mom did something that most women don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t do .
this should have been given to a boy . we can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t do this . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
i learned that she did not have to be abused because she is a woman .
and yes , she was older to be in fourth grade .
and we will live in a very peaceful world . thank you very much .
it took us 50 years to reach annual savings ratings of almost 10 percent . 50 years .
so we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re starting to pay for things with money that we have .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to go through four valu@@ e-@@ shifts that we see driving new consumer behaviors , that offer new management principles .
another quick example of these types of movements is the rise of zyn@@ ga .
but they also talk about the fact that their executives , all of their expense reports are put onto their company in@@ tran@@ et for everyone to see .
another great example is fidelity .
the traditional thing would be to boycott right ?
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s been tremen@@ d@@ ously powerful for consumers .
i know a woman who &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s good at this .
go home to your husband -- what does he need ?
in fact , i grew up observing two different kinds of wom@@ an@@ hood .
we tend to form clusters based on simil@@ arity , and then we produce stereotypes about other clusters of people .
i skipped school often and dreamed of becoming a sail@@ or during those days .
for me , like millions of other people around the world today , english is an acquired language .
many authors feel this pressure , but non-@@ western authors feel it more heavily .
but there were times when i wanted to remind both sides that this was fiction .
books have saved the intro@@ ver@@ ted , ti@@ mid child that i was -- that i once was .
au@@ dre lor@@ de once said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; the white fathers taught us to say , &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; i think , therefore i am . &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; she suggested , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; i feel , therefore i am free . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
i think these are the basic elements of all creativity .
now , american copyright and patent laws run counter to this notion that we build on the work of others .
that is all there is to it . apple has pat@@ ented this .
he records a song called &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; blind willie mc@@ tell , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; named after the blues singer , and the song is a voyage through the past , through a much darker time , but a simpler one , a time when musicians like willie mc@@ tell had few illu@@ sions about what they did .
just look at google maps here . there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s block 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 .
and one of the first victims of difficult economic times , i think , is public spending of any kind , but certainly in the firing line at the moment is public spending for science , and particularly curio@@ sit@@ y-@@ led science and exploration .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s about 500 kilometers in diameter .
so below the ice , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s an ocean of liquid around the whole moon .
well , this looks like a picture of virtually nothing .
and one of the astonishing predictions of quantum mechanics , just by looking at the structure of atom@@ s -- the same theory that describes transi@@ stors -- is that there can be no stars in the universe that have reached the end of their life that are bigger than , quite specifically , 1.4 times the mass of the sun .
it was made in stars like that , locked away and then returned to the universe in explosions like that in order to recon@@ dense into planets , stars , new solar systems and , indeed , people like us .
but it visited jupiter , saturn , ur@@ anus and neptune .
thank you .
the red dots you see up there are sites that are behavioral tracking that i have not navig@@ ated to , but are following me .
pretty simple -- it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s huge business .
thank you for being here .
you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re walking to make us feel bad . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
i was 27 . i thought i knew everything .
and they said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t worry about that . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
now this was a discussion class and we were having a discussion .
my dad said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s one , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; and i still didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t let that go .
i was walking through el dor@@ ado -- it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a prison town , famous prison , or infamous prison -- in venezuela , and i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t know what possessed me , because this was not like me .
but i know i needed to .
but even as a child , i could feel the hea@@ vin@@ ess in their hearts .
hope kept me alive .
my father tried very hard to motivate me into studying , but it didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t work .
in north korea , i made it myself .
i just wanted to say that i miss you , and i love you , and please come back to me and stay alive .
i was asked to design the building , because the theme of the expo was environmental issues .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the responsibility of architects .
i started commut@@ ing to kobe , and i met the society of vietnamese people .
i brought my japanese students to work with the chinese students .
i used the shipping container and also the students helped us to make all the building furniture to make them comfortable , within the budget of the government but also the area of the house is exactly the same , but much more comfortable .
and those two roles came together for me in a book that i wrote called &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; origins . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
now why would this kind of fetal learning be useful ?
and often it does something more .
when food is scarce , they divert nutrients towards the really critical organ , the brain , and away from other organs like the heart and liver .
but there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s another way of thinking about ptsd .
mt : this faith in the fictional is essential for any kind of theatrical experience .
the audience is led to make assumptions or elabor@@ ations that are perfectly reasonable , but do not , in fact , match what is being done in front of them .
and if the story is a good one , it might even make us smile .
so what i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m asking for is the creation of a new job title -- i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll come to this a little later -- and perhaps the addition of a new word into the english language .
but i was at a ted event recently and esther du@@ flo , probably one of the leading experts in , effectively , the eradi@@ cation of poverty in the developing world , actually spoke .
one of them also being , although logi@@ cally it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s quite a good idea to have a lift with no up and down button in it , if it only serves two floors , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s actually bloody terrifying , okay ?
because , if the board of directors convince everybody that the success of any organization is almost entirely dependent on the decisions made by the board of directors , it makes the disparity in salaries slightly more justi@@ fiable than if you actually acknowledge that quite a lot of the credit for a company &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s success might actually lie somewhere else , in small pieces of tactical activity .
so the first thing i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d like is a competition -- to anybody watching this as a film -- is to come up with a name for that stuff on the bottom right .
i become the medium through which the music is being chan@@ nel@@ ed , and in the process , when all is right , the music is transformed and so am i .
because this is about 10 dollars of additional hardware if you already have a nintendo wii .
but i also learned very soon thereafter that jesus also said , and i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m parap@@ hra@@ sing , the poor would always be with us .
the truth be told , i was giving out of that place , not out of a genuine place of hope and excitement to help and of generosity .
for the first time , actually , in a long time i wanted to meet those individuals , i wanted to meet these entrepreneurs , and see for myself what their lives were actually about .
i just got this impression that the money would work .
because as that happens , i think we can feel free to interact in a way that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s more open , more just and more creative , to engage with each other and to help each other .
so with that in mind , this particular incident has led to the things that i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m working on now .
so that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m working on now .
there is nothing bigger or older than the universe .
the universe can spontane@@ ously create itself out of nothing .
but we are entering an increasingly dangerous period of our history .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m a designer and an educator .
in other words , i look for aliens , and when i tell people that at a cocktail party , they usually look at me with a mil@@ dly incre@@ dul@@ ous look on their face .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a degree of an improvement that would look good on your report card , okay ?
so that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not so bad . i mean , even with two dozen years , you open up your browser and there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s news of a signal , or you get a cup of coffee .
it would change his day , all right ?
these sorts of ideas don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t really have any validity , that you can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t trust the scientists .
this allows you to pay it forward by using this subject as a hook to science , because se@@ ti involves all kinds of science , obviously biology , obviously astron@@ omy , but also ge@@ ology , also chemistry , various scientific discip@@ lines all can be presented in the gu@@ ise of , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re looking for e.@@ t. &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
let me just say , look , my job is a privilege because we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re in a special time .
after i was invited by ted , i did some digging , because that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what we do , to know about my host .
you find elephants , rhin@@ os , monkeys , pigs , etc .
in a way , this was like the second birth for the child , after 3.3 million years , but the labor was very long .
what do we actually know about our ancestors ?
what does that tell us ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
i think it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s important to promote in a more positive way on how we see ourselves .
for example , garbage discharge , something you would think just simply goes away , but the laws regulating ship discharge of garbage actually get weaker the further you are from shore .
but the sar@@ gas@@ so sea , the same way it aggre@@ gates sar@@ gas@@ sum weed , actually is pulling in the plastic from throughout the region .
getting closer to shore , where we are , this was in fact taken in the gal@@ ap@@ a@@ gos .
at the same time we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re saying , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; yes , we need more . we need to move forward . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
kristina g@@ jer@@ de : making law on the high seas
and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s focus . norman je@@ wi@@ son said to me , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; i think it all has to do with focusing yourself on one thing . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
why do people succeed ? is it because they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re smart ? or are they just lucky ? neither . analyst richard st. john conden@@ ses years of interviews into an unmiss@@ able 3-@@ minute sli@@ de@@ show on the real secrets of success .
death : go to i@@ fi@@ die@@ .net before it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s too late .
and this man , archie coch@@ ran@@ e , is a prisoner of war and a doctor , and he has a problem .
he very carefully and meti@@ culously notes his results in an exercise book .
and you know , with the future billions that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve been hearing about , the world is simply far too complex to understand in that way .
there are 100,000 there . it would take you all day .
i realize that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s an ambiguous statement .
even this problem , too complicated .
it didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t come because you put some incredibly smart person in charge .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s so uncomfortable .
would you like to close down the trial now , or should we wait until we have robust results ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
but he made mistakes in a good direction .
it will stop because of the end of trade resources .
i find this argument fascinating , as though we can kind of bend the rules of physics to suit our needs .
i accept where we are .
imagine our highly-@@ tuned , ju@@ st-@@ in-@@ time food industry and our highly-@@ stressed agricultural system failing and supermarket shelves empt@@ ying .
think about war .
we need to act like the future depends on it .
and i will try and give you a sense of what the ultimate reboot looks like .
and we thought we were going to be able to lay these debts off on our kids , but , guess what ?
everything else is mandated .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the financial crisis .
graduate students wanted a way of telling which stage they were in .
this should not surprise you , right ?
and all we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got is a room@@ ba .
and about two or three years after they can hear as well as you and i can , they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll be able to hear maybe how bats sing , or how whales talk , or how dogs talk , and other types of ton@@ al scales .
i think we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to move from a hom@@ o sa@@ pi@@ ens into a hom@@ o evolu@@ tis .
and the people thought , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; you know , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re right .
so in every car crash in which at least one person dies , they have information on all of the people .
and so if we look at recent crashes -- the whole data set is almost 30 years &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; worth of data -- you won &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t see it in the recent crashes . the new car seats are far , far better . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
so , let me show you what happens .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s some more evidence , so in some sense -- i was criticized by a scientist , who said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; you could never publish a study with an n of 4 , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; meaning those four crashes .
and it turned out that most people wouldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t come back , because it worked . but every once in a while , there was still a patient convinced that he was sick , and he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d come back . and my dad had a third jar of pills .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s in 5,000 days , all this stuff has come .
so , i was trying to basically make measurements .
so by the year 2040 , the total processing of this machine will exceed a total processing power of humanity , in raw bits and stuff . and this is , i think , where ray kurzwei@@ l and others get this little chart saying that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to cross .
right now , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not . if you do sp@@ read@@ sheets and things at work , a word document , they aren &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t on the web , but they are going to be . they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to be part of this machine .
m@@ clu@@ han was saying , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; machines are the extensions of the human senses . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
so every idea is basically being supported -- or every item , or every nou@@ n -- is being supported by the entire web .
so we have this database of things .
but it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll anticipate what we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re doing , in a good sense .
my journey to coming here today started in 1974 .
and so i decided to write a book , a memoir , about this decade of my life .
all i have to do is hum@@ bly follow .
and i organize it . and , well , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s also a bit different because an architect versus , let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s say , a dance company finally is a negotiation between one &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s private world , one &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s concep@@ tual world , the world of ideas , the world of aspirations , of in@@ ven@@ tions , with the relationship of the exterior world and all the limitations , the nay@@ sa@@ yers .
and it had to do with the notion of walking a kilometer , observing every kilometer a particular object of desire , and then placing that within this .
and then the broader ideas of city-@@ making start having direct influences on architecture , on the elements that make up the broader scheme , the buildings themselves , and start guiding us .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s transparent , and it allows you to understand , i think , what is always the most interesting thing in any building , which is the actual constru@@ ctional processes that make it .
we could talk about the relationship at a more biological sense of the relationship of building and ground .
they have 22 satellites zi@@ pping around at plus or minus 100 miles , and the site &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s in red .
well , then we get to this image .
please , also on the balcony .
you now , our brain is two to three percent of the body mass , but actually it uses 25 percent of the total energy we use .
you can continue to innov@@ ate and in@@ vent .
this is what we are using . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s this brain which makes this reflex .
then we would generate something all of us would like to have -- a balance between the hunger and the sati@@ ation .
and you could look at this art and you could , of course , see the complex social organization of the people who brought it into being .
10,000 square kilometers , tens of thousands of islands flung like jewels upon the southern sea .
the third noble truth said that ignorance can be overcome .
and then you do the ritual dances that empower the crosses .
they consume more co@@ ca leaves than any human population , half a pound per man , per day .
this little boy will never step outside of the sacred fields that surround the men &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s hut for all that time , until he begins his journey of initi@@ ation .
so , their entire year has been cut in half .
anthrop@@ ologist wade davis mu@@ ses on the worldwide web of belief and ritual that makes us human . he shares breathtaking photos and stories of the elder brothers , a group of sierra nevada indians whose spiritual practice holds the world in balance .
today , we use a single feed@@ stock , petroleum , to heat our homes , power our cars and make most of the materials you see around you .
the first is selecting a feed@@ stock , prefer@@ ably something that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s regional , that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s in your area , right -- local manufacturing .
it actually takes a little longer . it takes five days .
good afternoon .
now of course , the moment that it does hit the outside environment , and its temperature rises by even a fraction of a degree , it immediately turns back into normal matter .
but what seems so slow and gra@@ ceful from the outside is really more like chaos inside , because cells control their shape with a skeleton of rigid protein fi@@ bers , and those fi@@ bers are constantly falling apart .
as a test case , i propose we start with american dancers .
when they say to you , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; what do you do ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; -- you say , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m a statisti@@ cian . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got to think , and i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to ask you some questions .
so what you want to do is compare the average number of to@@ sses until we first see head-@@ tail@@ -@@ head with the average number of to@@ sses until we first see head-@@ tail@@ -@@ tail .
if it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a tail -- well , rather disap@@ poin@@ tedly , you put the glasses away and put the champagne back .
but it turns out that un@@ locking the secrets in the information generated by modern experimental technologies , a key part of that has to do with fairly sophisticated -- you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll be relieved to know that i do something useful in my day job , rather more sophisticated than the head-@@ tail@@ -@@ head story -- but quite sophisticated computer mode@@ lings and mathemati@@ cal mode@@ lings and modern statistical techniques .
so a natural answer is 99 percent .
one explanation is that the person doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t have the disease -- that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s overwhelmingly likely , if you pick someone at random -- but the test gets it wrong , which is unlikely .
it might well be that there are environmental factors that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re not aware of , and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s pretty likely to be the case that there are genetic factors we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re not aware of .
it has to do with weighing up the strength of the other evidence against her and the statistical evidence .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what engineers do . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
well , a couple of friends and i figured out how to do this .
there are 10 billion electrical outlets in north america alone .
and now , today i want to tell you my personal observation in the past several years , from that wall .
on the one hand , he wants to satisfy people &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s need of a social network , which is very important ; people really love social networking .
and later this year , the rail minister was sacked and sentenced to jail for 10 years .
at the commenting area , &@@ #@@ 9@@ 1@@ ; it makes &@@ #@@ 93@@ ; the chinese weibo more like facebook , rather than the original twitter .
for example , you can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t post the name of the president , hu jin@@ tao , and also you can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t post the city of ch@@ ong@@ qing , the name , and until recently , you can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t search the surname of top leaders .
so they want an excuse -- public opinion is a very good excuse to punish him .
whatever the future is , we should fight against the &@@ #@@ 9@@ 1@@ ; cat &@@ #@@ 93@@ ; .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s acoustic vibr@@ ations in the air , little waves of energy in the air that ti@@ ckle our ear@@ drum .
now hearing loss and the treatment for hearing loss has really evolved in the past 200 years .
girl : holly .
so if we had to design a perfect coch@@ le@@ ar im@@ plant , what we would try to do is target it to be able to allow music transmission .
coch@@ le@@ ar im@@ plant users cannot tell the difference between these instruments .
what that suggests is that , even in the case of hearing loss , the capacity for music remains .
he is now a medical student at yale university , and he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s contemplating a surgical career -- one of the first deaf individuals to consider a career in surgery .
when i look around this ted@@ x@@ amsterdam venue , i see a very special audience .
guns are not a part of our lives .
when he aimed , he never missed .
despite the pictures we are shown daily in the news , wars between developed countries are no longer commonplace .
the armed forces implement the state monopoly on violence .
i hope you will respect my soldiers , this soldier with this gun .
and the interesting thing is that if you change the sequence , you change the three-@@ dimensional folding .
we want to be able to build technological artifacts that are maybe good for the world . we want to learn how to build biological artifacts , like people and whales and trees .
and then what happens ?
women are much more in balance because they don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t have that idea that they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to be able to do 100 pul@@ l-@@ ups .
but we do have the potential to overcome disease and poverty , and i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to talk about those issues , if we have the will .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to show you just a few examples of how pervasive this phen@@ omena is .
there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a basic , profound acceleration of this evolutionary process .
i mean , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d think this is the result of some table@@ top experiment , but this is the result of worldwide chaotic behavior -- countries accusing each other of dumping products , i@@ pos , bankrupt@@ cies , marketing programs .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re understanding the software programs that make our body run .
these are some designs from eric dre@@ xler &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s book -- which we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re now showing are feasible with super-@@ computing simul@@ ations , where actually there are scientists building mole@@ cu@@ le-@@ scale robots .
doug hof@@ stadter wonders , well , maybe our intelligence just isn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t great enough to understand our intelligence , and if we were smarter , well , then our brains would be that much more complicated , and we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d never catch up to it .
computers will combine the subtle pan-@@ recognition powers of human intelligence with ways in which machines are already superior , in terms of doing analy@@ tic thinking , remembering billions of facts accurately .
invent@@ or , entrepreneur and visionary ray kurzwei@@ l explains in abundant , grounded detail why , by the 20@@ 20s , we will have rever@@ se-@@ engineered the human brain and nano@@ bots will be operating your consciousness .
so like fox mul@@ der on &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; x-@@ files , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; who wants to believe in u@@ fos ? well , we all do , and the reason for that is because we have a belief engine in our brains .
you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve been taken out of the gene pool .
because there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s nothing in this . well , allegedly there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s nothing .
an increase of dop@@ amine caused subjects to see more patterns than those that did not receive the dop@@ amine .
the other one also , but maybe too many patterns .
well here &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the late , great jerry an@@ dru@@ s &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; impossible cr@@ ate &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; illusion in 3d , in which jerry is standing inside the impossible cr@@ ate .
especially when they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re upside down , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re engaging that general facial recognition software there .
some conspira@@ cies really are true .
and this is test on some lip bal@@ ms that we have over here .
i love trees , and i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m very lucky , because we live near a wonderful ar@@ bor@@ et@@ um , and sundays , usually , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d go there with my wife and now , with my four-year-old , and we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d climb in the trees , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d play hide and seek .
but later the government soldiers began mistre@@ ating us a lot .
but this , surely , whoever that man is , whatever he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s done , this is cruel and unusual punishment .
so the question is , how do they deal with this material ?
what we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to do now is shade the sun with a board and then move the sun with a mirror to a completely different position .
every now and then , when they climb on top of the ball , they wipe their face .
so this is called stil@@ ting . it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a thermal behavior that you and i do if we cross the beach , we jump onto a towel , somebody has this towel -- &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; sorry , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve jumped onto your towel . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; -- and then you sc@@ utt@@ le across onto somebody else &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s towel , and that way you don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t burn your feet .
so here &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s our cun@@ ning experim@@ enter .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s about an 8-@@ foot-@@ long tube of metal , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s got a hundred or so holes on top , on that side is the speaker , and here is some lab tu@@ bing , and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s connected to this tank of pro@@ pan@@ e .
you see the sk@@ aters often trick in this direction . the obstacles are easier .
sometimes you get a little star applause , and then i think even bill gates takes a nervous breath , and the talk begins .
but he was credited with co@@ ining the phrase , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; because it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s there . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
i didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t see anyone else . we took this photo next to the helicopter .
it is , arguably , the most audac@@ ious endea@@ vor of that ed@@ war@@ dian golden age of exploration , and it seemed to me high time , given everything we have figured out in the century since from sc@@ ur@@ vy to solar panels , that it was high time someone had a go at finishing the job .
and so therefore , the entire purpose of a vc pitch is to convince them that you are the entrepreneur in whom they are going to invest their money and make a lot of money in return .
and now along with that , along with the experience of starting an enterprise , or running something -- and it doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t have to be a business .
there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s never been an angel@@ - or a vent@@ ure-@@ funded company where bad things didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t happen .
and then from there , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got to take them on a very solid , steady , upward path , right from beginning to end .
&@@ quo@@ t@@ ; we have no competition . there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s nobody else who &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s ever made a wid@@ get like this . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re focusing on him ! this is steve jobs .
you do that , you give me your quick 15-@@ second or 30-@@ second in@@ tro , grab my attention .
there has never been a company that doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t have competition .
this is that rocket going up .
number three : the hand@@ outs you give are not your presentation .
you can use it at ted .
this is the most successful order on the planet by far .
so when i click on &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; sympathetic magic , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; i get sympathetic magic and vo@@ o@@ doo dolls .
when i click on y@@ uri gag@@ arin &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s page , i get this guy who was surprisingly short in stature , huge in hero@@ ism .
by revolution , i mean a drastic and far-reaching change in the way we think and behave -- the way we think and the way we behave .
last .
because it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s shown the way we apply , generate and use knowledge is affected by our social and institutional context , which told us what in commun@@ ism ?
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a crap system .
and you can say , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s ridiculous , steve . what a dumb idea .
the more you play , the bigger the brains there are .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not fiction , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not story tales , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not make-@@ believe ; it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s cold , hard science .
for example , it stimu@@ lates creativity .
one , play is universal .
i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t care if it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s mountain bi@@ king or reading a book or playing a game .
unacceptable . ne@@ pri@@ em@@ liv .
all of these things were made during the last 75 years .
my work actually took me through many countries , and showed me a great part of the world .
however , everybody in the factory spent his time at the art department .
so i was arrested quite early in stalin &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s pur@@ ges , and spent 16 months in a russian prison .
this was bad ! man , i was -- i cough . i was sick .
idea about women .
obviously a really profound moment , and it changed our lives in many ways .
we really felt like what we went in expecting had nothing to do with what we were actually experiencing , and so we decided we really wanted to give it to parents straight .
but what i felt towards the child at that moment was deep affection , but nothing like what i feel for him now , five years later .
you can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t talk about how lonely having a baby can be .
and we were grateful that i was able to get pregnant , and i soon learned that we were having a boy , and then when i was five months , we learned that we had lost our child .
and i got about two-thirds of the way through , and there was a chart on the right-@@ hand side -- on the right-@@ hand page -- that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve labeled here &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; the most terrifying chart imagin@@ able for a new parent . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
av : yeah , and then you have your first child , and then you really re@@ submit yourself to these highs and lows -- the highs being the first steps , the first smile , your child reading to you for the first time -- the lows being , our house , any time from six to seven every night .
so the point of all this for us today is not just hopefully honesty for the sake of honesty , but a hope that by being more honest and candid about these experiences , that we can all collectively bend that happiness baseline up a little bit .
and , you know , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a thing your piano teacher teaches you , but we never had a science behind these kinds of things .
and then you heard the original .
your eyes are pretty happy with some color and movement , you know .
you want to hear it in different rooms and whatever .

and when people aren &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t allowed to be useful , they soon think that they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re useless .
a few of these . this is ati@@ lla the hen .
we know our societies have to radically change .
and some are quite structural , like social impact bonds where you raise money to invest in diver@@ ting teenagers from crime or helping old people keep out of hospital , and you get paid back according to how successful your projects are .
then monarchy had seen off its big challenger , mass democracy , which was seen as a well-@@ inten@@ tioned but doomed experiment , just as capitalism has seen off soci@@ alism .
despite all of these similarities , we see huge differences in savings behavior .
why ? because i have to consider that and i have to mo@@ dify what i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m saying to say , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; it will rain , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; or &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s going to rain . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
well , what i did with that was to access the lingui@@ stics literature .
the survey takes over a day .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s current pleasure in exchange for future pain .
of course , from their grandparents and even their great-@@ grandparents .

this delu@@ sion is a kind of prison for us , restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us .
and he had a lump of iron .
well , at least i can clean this wound and wash it . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;

i got mad . brothers can fight . parents and children can fight .
the mother is the model of all al@@ tru@@ ism for human beings , in spiritual traditions .
and so you see beings in their potential happiness .
and this is where you feel real compassion for them .
so , practice compassion , read the charter , dissemin@@ ate it and develop it within yourself .
but there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s another class of simple things , which are also very important .
we have a lot of interesting information about what complexity is .
all of us , to some extent , study this thing called a bill gates .
now , if you like to represent this zero and one of binary , you need a device .
all right , let me then finish off with four general statements , an example and two ap@@ hor@@ is@@ ms .
and i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t want to spend your time in going through the details , but in the lower right-@@ hand corner , you see an example of the kind of thing that we have .
but it does make a point -- which is one which , in a sense , differenti@@ ates the real world of people who make things , and the world of people who think about things , which is , there is an intellectual merit to asking : how do we make things as simple as we can , as cheap as we can , as functional as we can and as freely inter@@ conne@@ ctable as we can ?
so , they got the frames from these big bikes , put them together with the gears from the racing bikes , got the brakes from motor@@ cycles , and sort of mixed and matched various ingredients .
the ideas are coming back from the consumers , and they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re often ahead of the producers .
that sounds like a winner ; we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll go with it . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
well , just imagine a world , for the moment , divided into two camps .
or the op-ed page , where if they knew the editor -- had been to school with him , slept with his wife -- they could write an article for the op-ed page .
and i was having dinner with this guy called timothy chan .
if you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re a games company , and you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got a million players in your game , you only need one percent of them to be co-@@ developers , contributing ideas , and you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got a development workforce of 10,000 people .
this was a mother &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s day gift .
hundreds of re@@ mixes came back -- lots of different attempts .
and this is it , right , to feel and be felt .
recording : okay , here &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s something .
and he said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m dressed as batman to hide my identity . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
one person sent me a very detailed description ; the other person didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t .
right now , it feels like i forgot to turn the light on and things that looked so good yesterday are now shades of gray and it seems like the world is spinning while i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m standing still or maybe i am spinning i can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t tell and then you say hey you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re okay you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll be fine just breathe and now the words sing hey you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re okay you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll be fine just breathe now everybody sings hey you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re okay you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll be fine just breathe hey you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re okay you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll be fine just breathe hey you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re okay you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll be fine just breathe thank you .
so there is the pattern that every one of them had , but they all were a little different too .
but then my mother said to me , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; i hear you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve been going around talking about psych@@ opath@@ ic killers .
but our grand@@ kids are going to be kind of concerned here .
and we re-@@ create the conditions that were present less than a billion@@ th of a second after the universe began up to 600 million times a second inside that dete@@ ctor -- immense numbers .
imagine a snow@@ fla@@ ke in your hand , and you look at it , and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s an incredibly complicated , beautiful object . but as you heat it up , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll melt into a pool of water , and you would be able to see that , actually , it was just made of h@@ 20 , water .
but what he meant was that what we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve done , really , is stamp collect there .
so all the exqui@@ si@@ tely detailed calculations we can do with that wonderful equation wouldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t be possible without an extra bit .
so that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s one thing .
in about the first billion@@ th of a second or so , the hi@@ ggs field kicked in , and the quar@@ ks and the glu@@ ons and the elec@@ tr@@ ons that make us up got mass .
and i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m certainly looking forward with immense excitement to it being turned on .
so from pap@@ ua new guinea to hollywood all the way to modern art in beijing , we smile often , and you smile to express joy and satisfaction .
smiling can help reduce the level of stre@@ ss-@@ enhancing hormones like corti@@ sol , adrenaline and dop@@ amine , increase the level of moo@@ d-@@ enhancing hormones like endor@@ phin and reduce overall blood pressure .
but i told him no , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m sorry , compromise in colors is gray , and we have enough gray to last us a lifetime .
and this was not a misp@@ laced feeling .
we put the citizen first , and not the cler@@ ks .
ef@@ har@@ i@@ sto and kalin@@ ih@@ ta .
people that were hungry and hurting were signaling their distress , were signaling their need for help .
technology is transform@@ ational .
and not only is it empowering to the communities , but really importantly , this information stays in the community where it is needed to formul@@ ate long-term health poli@@ ces .
half the city was dark because of a power cut , and i was living on the dark side .
but the story is not about these chapters .
your last job , your dinner reservations from last year , your former friends , lie on a flat plain with today &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s friends , because the internet also archives , and it war@@ ps the past .
for us as individuals who live in the digital now and spend most of our waking moments in it , the challenge is to live in two streams of time that are parallel and almost simultane@@ ous .
i wanted to learn to cook , and she kept me in the kitchen , cutting , cu@@ bing and ch@@ opping for a whole month .
but if you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re like me , my humanity is more like a window .
i was seven .
and then the next planting season , when they sang the dir@@ ge , they would remove as many names of the dead that equ@@ aled as many people that were born .
i cried for a very long time .
he was obsessed .
there are some of you in this room , amazing people , who offer all of us the mirror to our own humanity .
if you take a close-@@ up of those , they look like this .
and if it is -- and particularly given the fact that we came very close to extinction .
so about 10,000 years ago by the black sea , we had one mutation in one gene which led to blue eyes .
three different options .
you can tag them with proteins that light up when you light them .
but one question you might want to ask is , are we seeing a rapid evolution of the brain and of how we process data ?
throughout human evolution , multiple versions of humans co-@@ existed . could we be mid-@@ upgrade now ? at ted@@ x@@ summit , juan enri@@ quez sweeps across time and space to bring us to the present moment -- and shows how technology is revealing evidence that suggests rapid evolution may be under way .
and when that happens there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s moment that causes this robot to roll .
you can send them inside buildings like this as first responders to look for intru@@ ders , maybe look for bio@@ chemical leaks , gas@@ eous leaks .
so the robot is obviously capable of executing any curve trajectory .
so when we have a robot which is surrounded by neighbors -- and let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s look at robot i and robot j -- what we want the robots to do is to monitor the separation between them as they fly in formation .
this is work done by quentin lindsey who &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a graduate student .
and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s how it popul@@ ates this map .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re very co-@@ evolved , because we depend on bees for pollin@@ ation and , even more recently , as an economic commodity .
there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a counter@@ intuitive trend that we noticed in these numbers . so let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s look at the first metric here , over@@ winter@@ ing survival .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s 1968 , and we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re pretty much covering asia .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s like , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; u@@ gh , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; so that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what we do .
i would like to encourage you to open your mind .
one is a supermarket standard : white bread , pre-@@ packaged , which i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m told is called a wonder@@ bread .
but we have , somehow , in the course of the last few centuries , or even decades , started to cultiv@@ ate an image of a my@@ thi@@ cal , rural agricultural past .
and this is true , as you can see , for all countries , including the so-called developing countries .
the costs have been tremendous -- water pollution , all the things you know about , destruction of our habitats .
in fact we do not want this poor woman to work the land like this .
but yes there are some solutions .
i want to see fish pon@@ ds in parking lots and bas@@ ements .
we need to make them proud of being a farmer because they allow us to survive .
living with a physical disability isn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t easy anywhere in the world , but if you live in a country like the united states , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s certain ap@@ pur@@ ten@@ ances available to you that do make life easier .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the person that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s sliding his hands up and down the le@@ vers , so the mechanism itself can be very simple and composed of bicycle parts you can get anywhere in the world .
and then you can also engage the end user in the design process , and not just ask him what he needs , but ask him how he thinks it can be achieved .
what my purpose of the talk today really is , is to sort of in@@ deli@@ bly scar your minds with these charismatic and majestic creatures .
and they didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t kill it . they called us to catch it .
and now the king cobra is a new one .
i mean , just incredible to see bun@@ ches of gh@@ ari@@ al bas@@ king on the river again .
and , you know , once a tox@@ in is in the food chain everything is affected , including us .
so , people talk about political will .
rw : yes , this is actually the first time anyone of us knew about it , for one thing .
and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not a diet .
now i thought , you know , if we just did good science , that would change medical practice . but , that was a little naive .
and yet , look at the number of prescriptions that are being sold .
but the problem is , you get hungry , so it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s hard to keep it off .
it also helps reduce the risk of the most common cancers like breast , prostate and colon cancer .
when we looked at their p@@ sa levels -- which is a marker for prostate cancer -- they got worse in the control group , but they actually got better in the experimental group , and these differences were highly significant .
it was a ran@@ domi@@ zed control study published in the lancet .
bp : i was born old .
the human form , in particular the human head , has been considered the holy gra@@ il of our industry .
and so , in 2004 , they commissioned us to do a screen test of benjamin .
and we also needed to make sure that we could take brad &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s idio@@ syn@@ cra@@ sies , his little tics , the little sub@@ tle@@ ties that make him who he is and have that translate through our process so that it appears in benjamin on the screen .
we started to look out in other fields .
this is when we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re like , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; ok , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to be ok , this is actually going to work . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and because the life cast , or the bust -- the ma@@ quette -- of benjamin was made from brad , we could tran@@ sp@@ ose the data of brad at 44 onto brad at 87 .
and then this is what we called the &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; dead head , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; no reference to jerry garcia .
so , effectively we created a digital puppet that brad pitt could operate with his own face .
and the bear cubs were being harve@@ sted from across the country and being sold and traded .
and then it started , there was no turning back after that .
and the beautiful bears can of course live in the wild again .
we were in the desert , in wadi rum , in a small jeep .
so as we talked , richard and i , i said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; you know , maybe i should bring a cam@@ el .
but not a big -- for instance , in ze@@ bras , they have a huge ear that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s very mobile , so they can actually turn them both around .
you can actually see , right here , it will vibr@@ ate .
well , if poor old su@@ ki is in search of a mate , what would su@@ ki do to find the perfect mate ?
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m built to last .
and i think when you look at the animal kingdom , that is one of the most remarkable things .
when i was poet laure@@ ate , there i go again -- i can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t help it , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s true -- i created a poetry channel on delta airlines that lasted for a couple of years .
some days i put the people in their places at the table , bend their legs at the knees , if they come with that feature , and fix them into the tiny wooden chairs .
the poem that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s coming up is based on him trying to tell me a little something about a domestic point of eti@@ quette in country living that i had a very hard time , at first , processing .
i just have time to read a more recent poem to you .
and so it makes you wonder , what would happen if we hadn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t tasted the fruit of knowledge , so to speak , and what kind of morality would we have ?
the wolf is , after all , a very cooperative animal .
he takes basically everything .
and so what we do in the next step is we release one elephant before the other , and that elephant needs to be smart enough to stay there and wait and not pull at the rope -- because if he pulls at the rope , it disappe@@ ars and the whole test is over .
humans ya@@ wn when others ya@@ wn .
in this case , we put two chim@@ pan@@ ze@@ es side-@@ by-@@ side .
and so we found that the chim@@ pan@@ ze@@ es do care about the well-being of somebody else -- especially , these are other members of their own group .
and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what she does .
so let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s watch a movement happen , start to finish , in under three minutes and dis@@ se@@ ct some lessons from it .
so first , if you are the type , like the shir@@ tless dancing guy that is standing alone , remember the importance of nur@@ turing your first few followers as equals so it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s clearly about the movement , not you .
but i decided to learn about the bible and my heritage by actually diving in and trying to live it and immer@@ se myself in it .
and my immun@@ ologist told me that i should also wipe down all of the remote controls and iphones in my house , because those are just or@@ gies of ger@@ ms .
without the sex part .
but i think we can use their techniques and apply them to healthy food .
so what we found was , when try@@ pt@@ op@@ han was low , people were more likely to take revenge when they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re treated unfairly .
but i didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t find any .
sure , it is involved in positive emotions like love and compassion , but it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s also involved in tons of other processes , like memory , language , attention , even anger , disgust and pain .
there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s just one problem .
and perhaps one arche@@ ologist becomes an instant celebrity when she discovers -- buried in the hills somewhere in north america -- massive versions of these same symbols .
or maybe that big ?
so as i showed you , they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re usually found on these seals that are very , very tiny .
now there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s several thoughts . there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s e. it could be i. it could be a , but certainly not b , c or d , right ?
we found that the indu@@ s script actually falls within the range of the lingui@@ stic scripts .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s our next big challenge .
today , we can write a word such as ted in egyptian hier@@ og@@ ly@@ phi@@ cs and in cun@@ ei@@ form script , because both of these were deci@@ pher@@ ed in the 19th century .
and this is the space probe cas@@ sin@@ i pi@@ rou@@ et@@ ting through the ice rings of saturn .
using the very first telephone , watson was in fact di@@ aled into the hea@@ vens .
a mysterious persistent noise was disrupting their research .
and as soon as they had laid all these , all their big stack of these jewel@@ ed par@@ as@@ ols that they used to carry in ancient india , he performed a kind of special effect which made it into a giant planet@@ arium , the wonder of the universe . everyone looked in that , and they saw in there the total inter@@ conne@@ c@@ te@@ dness of all life in all univer@@ ses .
because that cosmic basic idea that it is us all alone , each of us , and everyone else is different , then that puts us in an impossible situation , doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t it ?
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s really too boring whether you feel like this or like that , or what , you know -- and the more you focus on how you feel , by the way , the worse it gets .
look at that beautiful thing ch@@ ih@@ o showed us . she scared us with the lava man .
this is bir@@ han , who was the ethiopian girl who launched live aid in the 1980s , 15 minutes away from death when she was rescued , and that picture of her being rescued is one that went round the world .
but it took 24 years for the campaign to be successful .
amy wine@@ house said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; nelson mandela and i have a lot in common .
i have just been talking to the president of sierra leone .
so we have got to create in this world also institutions for peacekeeping and humanitarian aid , but also for reconstruction and security for some of the confli@@ ct-@@ ridden states of the world .
so you go to the literature .
the foot is distributed along the whole leg .
not just with the traditional foot , but also the leg , and even of the body .
and where they have a problem with this kind of mesh , because they don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t have sp@@ ines .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a secret . the animal effectively clim@@ bs by slipping and look -- and doing , actually , terribly , with respect to grabbing on the surface .
watch what happens when the foot goes onto your sandwich .
we discovered they work by inter@@ molecular forces alone .
and here it is coming up at you , in its first steps up a wall .
so there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a clear message : whether you care about a fundamental , basic research of really interesting , bizarre , wonderful animals , or you want to build a sear@@ ch-@@ and-@@ rescue robot that can help you in an earthquake , or to save someone in a fire , or you care about medicine , we must preserve nature &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s designs .
this is a calf in captivity making an im@@ itation if you hum@@ med this tune to your dog or cat and it hum@@ med it back to you , you ought to be pretty surprised .
as you can see at the top here , they share an up-@@ sweep , like &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; wo@@ op , wo@@ op , wo@@ op . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
notice how few barriers there are to movement across all of the oceans compared to land .
hum@@ p@@ backs , when they develop the ability to sing this song , they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re listening to other whales and mo@@ difying what they sing based on what they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re hearing , just like song birds or the dolphin whist@@ les i described .
but you can still hear that faint call .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll describe a couple strategies .
endangered whales are killed every year by ship collision , and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s very important to try to reduce this .
at the same time , we need to be really creative in thinking of solutions to be able to help reduce these problems .
first , it enables you to experience the universe : the worldwide telescope , for me , is a kind of magic carpet that lets you navigate through the universe where you want to go .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll be a free download -- thank you , craig mun@@ die -- and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll be available at the website world@@ wide@@ tele@@ sco@@ pe@@ .org , which is something new .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a social awkwar@@ dness like you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re a stranger in a foreign land .
that means they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re totally out of sync in traditional classes , which are analog , static , inter@@ actively passive .
we have so much technology nowadays that these inter@@ faces should start con@@ forming to us .
this kind of technology is going to let even more people get into it , and i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m really looking forward to interacting with all you guys over the next few days and seeing how it can apply to your respective fields .
corruption ? poverty ? or is it something else ?
we want to go on with our daily life even though we are not living under normal circumstances .
recently -- this is a sensitive figure -- 35 public lyn@@ ch@@ ings have been recorded so far in 2010 in mexico .
with a thousand juli@@ á@@ ns working together , mexico would be a very different country .
this is a call so that every single thing we love about mexico -- the festivals , the markets , the restaurants , the can@@ tin@@ as , the tequila , the mari@@ ach@@ is , the seren@@ ades , the po@@ sa@@ das , el grit@@ o , the day of the dead , san miguel , the joy , the passion for life , the fight and everything it means to be mexican -- doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t disappear from this world .
thanks . thank you . now , ju@@ ggling can be a lot of fun ; play with skill and play with space , play with rhythm .
or you can go back and change the height . now , skill .
bring it back up .
finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger .
why the hell should i learn this ? ok ?
and what do you dedicate it to , in exploring a particular thing ?
i apprenti@@ ced with a carpenter and learned about plum@@ b , square and level .
and the latest thing that i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m working on -- -- is something really -- i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t know what it is yet .
and so thinking back , i was thinking those of us in silicon valley were really focused on products or objects -- certainly technological objects .
i have a few of them -- they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re no more than a minute or a minute-@@ and-a-half apiece -- but i thought you might be interested in seeing some of our work over the last year , and how it responds in video .
then when you exit the ima@@ x theatre on the fourth floor -- mostly teenagers coming out of there -- there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s this big open space that has these tables in it that have interactive games which are quite fun , also designed by dur@@ rell &@@ #@@ 9@@ 1@@ ; bishop &@@ #@@ 93@@ ; and andrew &@@ #@@ 9@@ 1@@ ; hir@@ ni@@ ak &@@ #@@ 93@@ ; of it@@ ch .
and of course : a ham@@ mock for your afternoon nap that stretches across your cu@@ bi@@ cle .
you watch the video with super@@ imposed graphics that indicate your depth and compass heading .
there is more of it than you think , actually .
a photo is not enough . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
the laws of physics : invisible , eternal , omni@@ present , all-@@ powerful .
and i said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; yes . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; and he said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; why can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t i ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
i find that extraordinary , not to be able to see light , not to be able to see darkness .
&@@ quo@@ t@@ ; why are we here ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; and &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; what should we do about it while we are ?
this is extremely practical , but not so awesome .
so you have five million , that is , five million authors and five million plaintiffs is a massive lawsuit .
two rows from this table of two billion entries .
and it turns out that we can measure that very precisely .
so that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s sort of what we expect .
we have to make this available for people . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and when that happens , that will transform the way we have to understand our past , our present and human culture .
but that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not all .
this is not trivial .
or just try this one on for size .
and if we can teach listening in our schools , we can take our listening off that slippery slope to that dangerous , scary world that i talked about and move it to a place where everybody is consciously listening all the time -- or at least capable of doing it .
and meanwhile , i was touring locally and playing in night@@ clubs with my band , the dresden dolls .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve always been with my band or my crew .
and this starts happening all the time .
this is my kick@@ starter backer party in berlin .
well let me tell you , in terms of changing the world there has been a lot of competition this year , because the arab spring is still spreading , the eurozone has collapsed ... what else ?
actually , that photo was pa@@ sted in a police station , and what you see on the ground are id cards of all the photos of people being tracked by the police .
kids just make photos in a class , the teacher receives them , they paste them on the school .
i do two things : i design mobile computers and i study brains .
i thought the word framework was great .
one is -- the most basic one is -- people like to know things .
and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a real shame . now why has this come about ?
and finally , some people say , well , you know , i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t feel like a bunch of cells , you know . i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m conscious .
evolution &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the same thing . we taught our kids , well , the bible says , you know , god created all these species , cats are cats , dogs are dogs , people are people , plants are plants , they don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t change .
and that somehow , prediction leads to intelligent behavior .
and in the future , when it sees something similar to that again , so in a similar environment , or the exact same environment , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll play it back . it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll start playing it back .
door , door , door , you know , color , you know what i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m saying .
then , if in that framework , you take a bunch of theore@@ ti@@ cians .
no doubt that it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s going to happen , in my mind .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m actually here to make a challenge to people .
just that little bit of money , which to me , i wish it was in my bank account -- it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not , but ...
i spoke with aung sun suu kyi a couple of days ago .
but if they were together planting trees for the environment , it was okay -- creativity .
but it was the actions , together , of all of us that brought about that change .
today , in sweden and other rich countries , people are using so many different machines .
but when i lecture to environment@@ ally-@@ concerned students , they tell me , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; no , everybody in the world cannot have cars and washing machines . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
second , economic growth .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a real challenge in the future .
i would like to tell you a story connecting the notorious privacy incident involving adam and eve , and the remarkable shift in the boundaries between public and private which has occurred in the past 10 years .
do you see where i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going with this ?
discrimination was happening through social media for equally skilled candidates .
we repeated the experiment with the same two groups , this time adding a delay between the time we told subjects how we would use their data and the time we actually started answering the questions .
they become aware . they achieve autonomy .
i once -- this was years ago -- i saw ted kennedy and dan qu@@ ay@@ le meet in the well of the senate .
and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s led to a view of human nature that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re rational individuals who respond in straightforward ways to incentives , and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s led to ways of seeing the world where people try to use the assumptions of physics to measure how human behavior is .
they have kids of their own , and they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve achieved a genetic miracle by marrying beautiful people , so their grand@@ moms look like gertru@@ de stein , their daughters looks like halle berry -- i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t know how they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve done that .
people with strokes and lesions in the emotion@@ -@@ processing parts of the brain are not super smart , they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re actually sometimes quite helpless .
but i think this research shows that the british enligh@@ ten@@ ment , or the scottish enligh@@ ten@@ ment , with david hu@@ me , adam smith , actually had a better handle on who we are -- that reason is often weak , our sentiments are strong , and our sentiments are often trustworthy .
nin@@ et@@ y-@@ six percent of college students say they have abo@@ ve-@@ average social skills .
but this is the source of innovation .
thank you .
and i tell you stories from there .
we are living among those men : they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re our brothers , fathers , un@@ cles , cousins , all around us .
she works for a very big company , a workshop in hyderabad , making fur@@ n@@ itu@@ res .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s very fashionable to talk about human trafficking , in this fantastic a-@@ c hall .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m asking you , for these children , whose faces you see , they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re no more .
just to let you know , i do not have a lexi@@ co@@ graphical whistle .
computers ! what about computers ?
so -- -- now , when you think about this , what we have here is a ham butt problem .
no . there will still be paper diction@@ aries .
you didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t break it . it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s just in a new position , and that new position can be just as beautiful .
if we think of the dictionary as being the map of the english language , these bright spots are what we know about , and the dark spots are where we are in the dark .
because i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to the internet , which is where everybody goes .
and we can make the dictionary not just be a symbol of the language -- we can make it be the whole language .
the date was february 2000 .
we talk about this a lot , and i thought about trying to give an example of this . so , just one example : madame de gau@@ lle , the wife of the french president , was famously asked once , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; what do you most desire ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
jeff bezos kindly remarked to me , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; chris , ted is a really great conference .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m in this for the long run , and i would be greatly honored and excited if you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll come on this journey with me .
for one thing , gps doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t work indoors , and for another , they don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t make devices quite this small , especially when those devices have to relay their measurements back over a network .
in fact , as i looked into her case , i discovered to my surprise that it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not clearly illegal for you or me to put a tracking device on someone else &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s car .
so let me show you how this works .
so something felt very wrong about the world .
we call ourselves por@@ s and rao , and we live and work in india .
this is a video prototype .
but as soon as they passed by , it would start to climb up the wall in jer@@ ky fashion .
and once a creature pops into our minds , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s almost like the process of creation is to discover the way this creature really wants to exist and what form it wants to take and what way it wants to move .
but we move to cities , toward the bright lights , and one of the things that is there that we want , besides jobs , is electricity .
likewise , with solar , especially here in california , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re discovering that the 80 solar farm schemes that are going forward want to basically bulldo@@ ze 1,000 square miles of southern california desert .
so arguing against , a man who &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s been at the nit@@ ty , gritty heart of the energy debate and the climate change debate for years .
and this doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t even account for the footprint on the ground .
over the ocean , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not even land .
nuclear , the time lag alone will allow the arctic to melt and other places to melt more .
solving the world &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s problems can be done , if you really put your mind to it and use clean , renewable energy .
thank you .
so each of you has really just a couple sentences -- 30 seconds each to sum up .
sham@@ eless . sham@@ eless . sham@@ eless .
we explore for three reasons , the wea@@ kest of which is curiosity .
the shuttle is costing a billion dollars a launch .
100 bucks . that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the pri@@ ce-@@ improvement curve that -- we need some break@@ through@@ s in physics along the way , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll grant you that .
we went -- i went to 100 , 200 ceos , c@@ mos .
when you want the taste that won &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t weigh you down , the only way to go is up .
then , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got to , you know , face potential public ridi@@ cule of -- that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a crazy idea , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll never work .
nature &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s main process of creation , mor@@ pho@@ genesis , is the splitting of one cell into two cells .
i designed the process that generated the form .
and unlike traditional architecture , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a single process that creates both the overall form and the micro@@ scopic surface detail .
it took me several months to design the column , but ultimately it takes the computer about 30 seconds to calculate all of the 16 million faces .
there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s that dip there for the 1918 flu .
you weed down through various steps that cause many of these to fail .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s called hutchin@@ son-@@ gil@@ ford pro@@ geri@@ a , and it is the most dramatic form of premature aging .
so i just want to say a couple more things about that particular story , and then try to gener@@ alize how could we have stories of success all over the place for these diseases , as sam says , these 4,000 that are waiting for answers .
you probably know , if you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve been paying attention to some of the science literature that you can now take a skin cell and encourage it to become a liver cell or a heart cell or a kidney cell or a brain cell for any of us .
if you don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t believe me , just ask sam .
and for us young people , they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re looking to become individuals and find their differences amongst themselves .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re here , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re part of a community , sharing out ideas and discussing them .
this institution is government-@@ backed and it has been the case for the past three decades .
useless .
my work is -- it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a reflection of myself .
at that age , obviously , i couldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t express it that way , but i told her i didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t feel right .
it became part of me .
and i looked at it beneath the micro@@ scope . and some of it was flat .
so to cut the story short , i decided that i had to go back and do it .
can anybody see the blade on the end of that needle ?
and i looked at it underneath the micro@@ scope .
i remember one time i was doing it , and the window was open .
i used a micro@@ scopic sh@@ ard of diamond to actually car@@ ve the actual base .
constructed each plan@@ k of gold .
and these doctors or these masters , these spiritual masters of the suf@@ i tradition , refer to teach@@ ings and examples of our prophet that teach us where the source of our problems lies .
all we have to do is to get our e@@ gos out of the way , get our e@@ goti@@ sm out of the way .
and these should also be the primary attributes of what it means to be human .
and one day i was exploring this cul@@ -@@ de-@@ sac hidden away a few streets away .
the next day i came to see him . i was like , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; doctor , that was a really good joke . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
in arkansas they don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t even ask . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and jeff came up beside me and said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; so , have you ever been cow tipping ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
two weeks after my diagnosis , a biop@@ sy confirmed i had a seven-@@ inch oste@@ o@@ sar@@ coma in my left fe@@ mur .
and i hung up the phone , and i put my face in my hands , and i screamed this silent scream .
and one of the profound things that happened was this act of actually connecting to all these people .
don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t give in to the wall .
and every seven sets of seven years , the land gets an extra year of rest during which time all families are reunited and people surrounded with the ones they love .
so if you go to 23@@ and@@ me , or if you go to coun@@ ci@@ lof@@ da@@ ds@@ .com , you can click on a link .
ao : you did teach yourself to play , and as a consequence , playing the piano for you , derek , was a lot of knu@@ ck@@ les and kar@@ ate ch@@ ops , and even a bit of nose going on in there .
and hopefully we can show the audience now how it is you do what you do .
dp : &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; flight of the bu@@ mble@@ bee &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; on that note .
dp : he played &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; chop@@ sticks . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; ao : and played &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; chop@@ sticks . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
this is known as the theme building ; that is its name for reasons that are still very mur@@ ky .
does anyone know ? chi ?
they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re fighting to develop their own way of living within the forest in a world that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s clean , a world that isn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t contaminated , a world that isn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t pollut@@ ed .
and we use gs@@ i -- geographic whatever it is , gs@@ i -- to determine the range of the chim@@ ps .
we now know that at gom@@ be alone , there are nine different ways in which chim@@ pan@@ ze@@ es use different objects for different purposes .
so , the sad thing is that these chim@@ pan@@ ze@@ es -- who &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve perhaps taught us , more than any other creature , a little humility -- are in the wild , disappearing very fast .
the one thing we have , which makes us so different from chim@@ pan@@ ze@@ es or other living creatures , is this sophisticated spoken language -- a language with which we can tell children about things that aren &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t here .
there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s little bro@@ ch@@ ures all around outside , and if any of you have anything to do with children and care about their future , i beg that you pick up that bro@@ ch@@ ure .
we want to go and spend time with the old people and hear their stories and record their oral histories .
and i believe that a group like this can have a very major impact , not just because you can share technology with us , but because so many of you have children .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s in your hands and my hands and those of our children .
so how do we do this ? well , we use a model system that we term a proto@@ cell .
it could run a metabolism on it .
it can sense its local environment and actually find resources in the environment to sustain itself .
so since we can make some interesting proto@@ cells that we like , interesting colors and interesting behaviors , and they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re very easy to make , and they have interesting life@@ like properties , perhaps these proto@@ cells have something to tell us about the origin of life on the earth . perhaps these represent an easily accessible step , one of the first steps by which life got started on the early earth .
this is used in reference to a report in 2007 by the national research council in the united states , wher@@ ein they tried to understand how we can look for life elsewhere in the universe , okay , especially if that life is very different from life on earth . if we went to another planet and we thought there might be life there , how could we even recognize it as life ?
80 to 90 percent of their time was spent on five things .
the culmination of this is if you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve successfully raised your ta@@ d@@ pole , observing the behavioral and developmental events , you will then go and introduce your ta@@ d@@ pole to its name@@ sake and discuss the evidence that you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve seen .
there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s an old cellphone in there -- a good use for old cell@@ phones -- which di@@ als the clinic , we go and pick up the mouse .
what the climate crisis has revealed to us is a secondary , more insi@@ dious and more pervasive crisis , which is the crisis of agency , which is what to do .
and then i swap it out with the students and actually re-@@ release that carbon black .
and an early test which argument eli@@ cited cooperative behavior from the people below -- about a hundred to one decided that this was the argument that worked best on us .
in this case , instead of throwing che@@ wing gum , or dor@@ it@@ os or whatever you have in your pocket at the fish -- there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a body of water in iceland that i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve been dealing with that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s in the middle of the city , and the largest pollution burden on it is not the road@@ borne pollution , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s actually white bread from people feeding the fish and the birds .
did you know that today we maintain a global herd of 60 billion animals to provide our meat , dairy , eggs and leather goods ?
the animal could be a cow , lamb , or even something more exotic .
it need not look like this , which is actually the state of the art today .
he didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t write &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; little red laptop computer &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; or &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; little red dirt devil . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and sequel truly is a real car .
we actually think the future &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s going to be event-@@ driven .
and secondly , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a fundamental business proposition .
so my mom said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going on a bus an hour and a half away from where we live every day . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s like , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; no , miss , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m not going .
animation , software , mo@@ vie@@ making software , they have it all .
when i was 15 years old , it was necessary for me to leave this place and go to a town a little bit bigger -- much bigger -- where i did the second part of secondary school .
you must stop . stop .
we worked with a lot of companies in brazil that put money into this project , the government .
i put the question -- three or four weeks ago , we saw in the newspapers millions of fish that die in norway .
we here inside the room , i believe that we have the same concern , and the model that we created in brazil , we can transplant it here .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d go to times square and i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d look at the amazing ladies on the wall , and wonder why nobody is looking at the historical figures just behind them .
you can see the li@@ spen@@ ard meadows draining down through here , through what is tri@@ bec@@ a now , and the beaches that come up from the battery , all the way to 4@@ 2nd st .
we know that there was a len@@ ape settlement down here by the collect pond .
and rapidly we started to realize that bea@@ vers can be something that a bob@@ cat needs .
and perhaps a black bear walked by . and maybe native americans were there .
and even though i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve only had a brief time to speak , i hope you appreciate that man@@ nah@@ atta was a very special place .
and , you know , built the society that we now live in .
and they may not want to live exactly like us .
and people who live in cities in the developed world tend to be very prosperous , and thus use a lot of stuff .
another thing that information technology lets us do is start figuring out how to use less stuff by knowing , and by monitoring , the amount we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re actually using .
most of those cites are growing incredibly quickly .
so one of the things that that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s leading to is a sort of southern cultural explosion .
so lula , he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s full of problems , full of contradi@@ ctions , but one of the things that he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s doing is , he is putting forward an idea of how we engage in international relations that completely shifts the balance from the standard sort of north-@@ south dialogue into a whole new way of global collaboration .
here &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a design for distil@@ ling water using sunlight .
you know , that it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not just enough to survive .
sop@@ a stands for the stop online pira@@ cy act .
we do like to consume , but every time one of these new tools came along , it turned out we also like to produce and we like to share .
that is a side effect of their ordinary operation .
so this is the internet they have in mind .
they don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t want legal distin@@ ctions between legal and illegal sharing .
it changed my life .
&@@ quo@@ t@@ ; what are you doing here ?
so the college works following the lifestyle and work@@ style of mah@@ at@@ ma gandhi .
we are the only ones who actually returned the award for $ 50,000 , because they didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t believe us , and we thought that they were actually casting asper@@ sions on the bare@@ foot architects of ti@@ lon@@ ia .
but the people who fabricated that solar cooker are women , il@@ liter@@ ate women , who actually fabri@@ cate the most sophisticated solar cooker .
she has a cabinet , a minister of education , a minister for energy , a minister for health .
men are rest@@ less , men are ambitious , men are compul@@ sively mobile , and they all want a certificate .
and they haven &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t collapsed .
i knew which woman i would like to take .
don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t listen to the world bank , listen to the people on the ground .
our narrative here is real f@@ mri data that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s ma@@ pped visually and son@@ ically .
oxygen , hydrogen and zin@@ c have their own signature .
and yet in two million years the human brain has nearly tripled in mass , going from the one-@@ and-a-@@ quarter pound brain of our ance@@ stor here , habi@@ lis , to the almost three-@@ pound meat@@ loaf that everybody here has between their ears .
because the fact is that a year after losing the use of their legs , and a year after winning the lotto , lottery winners and parap@@ legi@@ cs are equally happy with their lives .
who are these characters who are so damn happy ?
and then finally -- you know , the best of all possible worlds -- some of you recognize this young photo of pete best , who was the original drummer for the beatles , until they , you know , sent him out on an er@@ rand and snu@@ ck away and picked up ring@@ o on a tour .
in this case , because the experiment i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to tell you about uses them , these are mon@@ et prints .
we explained we would have number three ma@@ iled to them .
it turns out that freedom -- the ability to make up your mind and change your mind -- is the friend of natural happiness , because it allows you to choose among all those delicious futures and find the one that you would most enjoy .
so we gave them cameras ; they went around campus ; they took 12 pictures of their favorite professors and their dorm room and their dog , and all the other things they wanted to have harvard memories of .
they don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t like their picture , and in fact even after the opportunity to swap has expired , they still don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t like their picture . why ?
thank you .
sometimes they just explode before your eyes or come down su@@ personic .
i have a little cuban mother -- she &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s about that big .
&@@ quo@@ t@@ ; pap@@ i , help . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
i was born in 19 -- i forget , and i came to this country with them in the aftermath of the cuban revolution .
and that meant that everyone in the family had to sign up to take her to have her hair d@@ yed , you know , that peculiar color of blue that matches her polyester pants suit , you know , same color as the bu@@ ick .
she gets into the car -- she &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s sitting on two phone books .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll help my breathing . it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll do something for my pulse , maybe .
now , you have all been at a mall during the holidays , yes ?
by now , we have now craw@@ led another four feet , and my mother finally says to me , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; i knew it , i knew it .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll wait for the slow ones . ok .
&@@ quo@@ t@@ ; no , my daughter , she &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s coming in the bu@@ ick .
people are watching us all around , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; right ?
i almost miss it .
what zip@@ car does is we park cars throughout dense urban areas for members to reserve , by the hour and by the day , instead of using their own car .
it required that it was completely trivial : that it takes 30 seconds to reserve a car , go get it , drive it .
so again , we can see that price plays an enormous role in people &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s willingness to reduce their driving behavior .
these are also called mesh networks .
these are the next two lines in the movie .
and this open-@@ source version means that it could be -- if we did a brilliant job of it -- it could be used around the world very quickly .
2006 was a great year .
and as these dark clouds were circling me , and i was finding it really , really difficult to think of anything good , i said to myself that i really needed a way to focus on the positive somehow .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d love to just talk about each one briefly .
so there was a time when it was your first time ever hitting a string of green lights on the way home from work .
so those are the three a &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s .
he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s like , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; do you know where morocco even is ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the sad part .
tourist : i think that people are very frustrated that they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re not able to get closer to see what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s going on .
and i thought it was astonishing to speculate , as if this were a competition , on something that was such a fresh wound .
dr : it was not an inclusive group .
so dealing with it is just an immediate master plan .
sort of like the spinal tap scene where you get the tiny little ston@@ eh@@ enge , i guess ?
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s all incredibly humble material .
and i truly believe until the issue of memorial is sorted out , that it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s going to be very hard to have an intelligent discussion .
those kinds of forms ?
so you can get kind of a feel for this .
but how about the kid on the left , or the athlete that leaves the field of play ?
let me tell you what i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve come up with .
how old it is ?
and today , we have what is perhaps our most offensive definition , at least to me , which is the following : to do@@ odle officially means to daw@@ dle , to dil@@ ly d@@ ally , to monkey around , to make meaningless marks , to do something of little value , substance or import , and -- my personal favorite -- to do nothing .
we think do@@ od@@ ling is something you do when you lose focus , but in reality , it is a pre@@ emp@@ tive measure to stop you from losing focus .
in 2002 , a group of treatment activists met to discuss the early development of the airplane .
treatment programs became possible , funding became available , and the number of people on anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs started to increase very rapidly .
so surely if a patent pool could be established to ramp up the production of military airplanes , we should be able to do something similar to tackle the hiv / aids epidemic .
the rule is about a 10-year delay for a new product to go to market in developing countries , if at all .
what about athens ? mediterranean climate , but in the sun it was not comfortable . they didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t perceive comfort .
instead of blowing a hurricane of chilled air through the stadium , we can use radi@@ ant cooling technologies , like a floor heating system where water pipes are embedded in the floor .
and i also hope that you share the idea that if engineers and designers can use all these different cli@@ matic parameters , it will be possible to create really good and comfortable outdoor conditions , to change our thermal perception that we feel comfortable in an outdoor environment , and we can do that with the best passive design , but also using the energy source of the site in qatar which is the sun .
the main thing is a fi@@ x-@@ it-@@ locally culture , which is fantastic because it means that your product or your service doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t have to go through a huge bureaucratic system to get it fixed .
they are basically referral services , essentially .
so we are right now doing some systematic field tests to basically as@@ certain whether something like this actually makes sense to the asha worker .
and i started to see the world in a whole new way , like pairs of people connected to each other .
and , most importantly , what causes the clusters ?
and we thought this was a very interesting comment on america , and a kind of self-@@ serving , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; not my responsibility &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; kind of phenomenon .
i mean , there would be an advantage to experiencing our emotions inside , you know , anger or happiness .
so to invoke another metaphor , if you imagine social networks as a kind of vast fabric of humanity -- i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m connected to you and you to her , on out endlessly into the distance -- this fabric is actually like an old-fashioned american quil@@ t , and it has patches on it : happy and unhappy patches .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s my social experience . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re both made of carbon , and yet one of them has carbon atom@@ s in it that are arranged in one particular way -- on the left -- and you get graph@@ ite , which is soft and dark .
you read about it in your newspapers .
the cdc recently conducted a survey where they asked respondents simply to tell them whether they experienced significant psychological distress in the previous week .
in our study , they are more positive , but they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re also more likely than younger people to experience mixed emotions -- sadness at the same time you experience happiness ; you know , that tear in the eye when you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re smiling at a friend .
we go on blind dates .
i mean , this is literally human beings with super-@@ human strength and abilities .
we got mad@@ d ch@@ add , lil &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; c , kid david and j smooth .
the l@@ x@@ d electri@@ fy the ted@@ 2010 stage with an emerging global street-@@ dance culture , rev@@ ved up by the internet . in a preview of jon chu &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s upcoming web series , this astonishing trou@@ pe show off their super@@ powers .
according to the treaty , those lands are a sovereign nation .
we had plans .
on december 29th , u.s. troops surrounded a si@@ oux en@@ cam@@ pment at wounded knee creek and massa@@ cred chief big foot and 300 prisoners of war , using a new rapi@@ d-@@ fire weapon that fired exploding shells called a hot@@ ch@@ kiss gun .
2010 : statistics about native population today , more than a century after the massacre at wounded knee , reveal the legacy of coloni@@ zation , forced migration and treaty violations .
those events led to a domino effect that has yet to end .
so , that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s really the goal of my talk , is to a , communicate that moment to you and b , have you leave this session a little dum@@ ber than when you entered .
many of these deaths were completely preventable , and this what i want to think of as the dis@@ concer@@ ting thing , what i want to call &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; the last mile &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; problem .
inter@@ cro@@ pping . inter@@ cro@@ pping really increases income .
so , here are these women . they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve seen their parents have struggled with diarr@@ he@@ a , they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve struggled with diarr@@ he@@ a , they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve seen lots of deaths . how do they answer this question ?
so , somebody out there says , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; five . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
almost out of kindergarten .
they are saying , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; this is 35 miles per gallon . i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to do the environmentally right thing , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to buy the pri@@ us , 50 miles per gallon . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
now , this is an example of that battle , and makes us realize intentions don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t always translate into action , and so one of the fundamental challenges is how we would actually do that . ok ?
this isn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t about the biology of people ; this is now about the brains , the psychology of people , and innovation needs to continue all the way through the last mile .
the careful testing , re@@ testing , design , are going to open up vi@@ stas of understanding , complexities , difficult things .
mac@@ arthur winner send@@ hi@@ l mul@@ la@@ in@@ athan uses the lens of behavioral economics to study a tricky set of social problems -- those we know how to solve , but don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t . we know how to reduce child deaths due to diarr@@ he@@ a , how to prevent diabe@@ te@@ s-@@ related blin@@ dness and how to implement solar-@@ cell technology ... yet somehow , we don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t or can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t . why ?
right , the current wants to run through the play-@@ dough , not through that led .
so i would encourage you all to grab some play-@@ do@@ h , grab some salt , grab some sugar and start playing .
and a friend of mine in austria felt so sorry for me that he talked the largest casino owner in linz into letting us wrap his building .
but i will demonstrate different ways to get rid of difficulties and go to the point , to find an answer probably much quicker than arthur did . so , first , we violate the common sense , the logic . all of you , if you hold your hand like this , 90 degrees -- all of you . not you .
now , i need an assistant .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a challenge . i like this .
so here i have , actually -- i know exactly where the cards are .
and if you work with , in the right atmosphere , with humor , you have -- that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the password to the cosmic bank of knowledge , where you can find any solution of any problem .
and then , i will demonstrate a thing from russian satellite , ste@@ alen -- stolen , probably copi@@ ed from america but we will see .
when i lift the heap , i peek .
we do it again .
this is a kind of optical deal , right ?
now -- -- one guy laughed . so now , to find the queen , do it this way : take back the other one , take back the queen .
king of spa@@ des .
do with both hands , and quick . yes , good , good .
right ? good .
two -- and it was two of spa@@ des , right ?
yes ? zoe : yeah .
king of diamonds . lg : ah !
now , what happened was not maybe what you thought , which is , he suddenly became passionate , engaged , involved , got a new teacher , he hit puberty , or whatever it is .
and your children are playing instruments .
the ton@@ e-@@ deaf people , they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re no longer here .
now , it goes down to a. now to g. and then to f .
and then finally ...
finally , i said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; why am i cla@@ pping ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
he depends , for his power , on his ability to make other people powerful .
unfortunately , it was the last thing she ever said to him , because she never saw him again . he did not survive .
some of you might have seen this before .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a nice motiv@@ ator .
so gluck@@ sberg did another experiment similar to this where he presented the problem in a slightly different way , like this up here . okay ?
the rules are my@@ stifying .
what happens ?
these are the building blocks of an entirely new operating system for our businesses .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s pretty . it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not bad . it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a huge trademark violation , but it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s pretty clever .
do it for fun . no one gets paid a cent , or a euro or a yen .
so , it can balance on a point .
so here is the earth . it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a little less than a millimeter that was turned of solid bronze .
this is another species of work that i do .
and the idea that you could see things inside of a crystal ball and predict the future -- or a television set , where it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s sort of like a magic box where anything can appear .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s completely silent and non@@ polluting .
the real social innovation i want to talk about involves charity .
you know , you want to make 50 million dollars selling violent video games to kids , go for it .
charitable giving has remained stuck , in the u.s. , at two percent of gdp ever since we started measuring it in the 1970s .
well , like most fanati@@ cal dog@@ ma in america , these ideas come from old pur@@ it@@ an beliefs .
within nine years , we had multipli@@ ed that 1,9@@ 82 times into 108 million dollars after all expenses for aids services .
but if we could move charitable giving from two percent of gdp up just one step to three percent of gdp , by investing in that growth , that would be an extra 150 billion dollars a year in contributions , and if that money could go disproportionately to health and human services charities , because those were the ones we encouraged to invest in their growth , that would represent a tri@@ pling of contributions to that sector .
and suddenly , out of the chaos , order .
you know , audiences like you , yeah , make the event .
can we have a little demonstration ? would you be my orchestra for a second ?
and our joy of music , etc . , etc . ... &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and then like kar@@ a@@ jan . let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s see what happens . okay ?
meaning that you know you have no authority to change anything .
this is very exciting for those players .
rather enjoying what the solo@@ ist is doing .
you know why ? because the meaning of the music is pain .
but all my work for many years was focused around the idea that sustainability means basically looking at the glob@@ alized economic growth model , and moder@@ ating what comes in at one end , and moder@@ ating the out@@ puts at the other end .
but are we to assume that the same brilliance and creativity and adapt@@ ability that got us up to the top of that energy mountain in the first place is somehow mysteri@@ ously going to evapor@@ ate when we have to design a creative way back down the other side ?
and in terms of climate change , is something that is not actually feasible .
it learns very much from its mistakes .
so it started out with some work i was involved in in ireland , where i was teaching , and has since spread .
from three years ago , it just being an idea , this has become something that has vir@@ ally swept around the world .
well , this is about state budgets .
there are various things in here : i could say we might raise more revenue , or medical innovation will make the spending even higher .
is anyone paying attention to some of the things these guys do ?
and unfortunately , as you get into that , people get confused and think , well maybe you think that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s okay .
so what do we need to do ?
it allows us to do the art , the bio@@ technology , the software and all those magic things .
and after two more years of studying music , i decided to shoot for the impossible before taking the mc@@ at and applying to medical school like a good indian son to become the next dr. gupta .
ke@@ ats himself had also given up a career in medicine to pursue poetry , but he died when he was a year older than me .
anyone living in that house can tell the time just by the smell .
these people i still do hang out with .
all right , next .
don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t they just pop into your head ?
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s amazing . it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a wonderful moment .
had he shown his father , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; my boy has finally lost it , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; he would &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve thought .
the french writer michel tour@@ nier has a famous saying .
and i explained , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a dark night and a crow is per@@ ching on a branch . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
yes , it means i didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t have to draw g@@ ye@@ ong@@ ho@@ er@@ u .
we become dictat@@ ors with a remote and start to criticize the people on tv .
i walk around and encourage them , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; come on , come on ! &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; they have to write like crazy for an hour or two .
art is the ultimate goal .
only those three words and she left the airport . that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s it .
british physi@@ cist john ty@@ nd@@ all , in the 18@@ 50 &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s , made laboratory measurements of the infrared radiation , which is heat .
i had been using the first line of the nasa mission statement , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; to understand and protect the home planet , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; to justify my talks .
climate change deniers argue that the sun is the main cause of climate change .
methane is also beginning to escape from the perma@@ frost .
it would be im@@ moral to leave these young people with a climate system spir@@ aling out of control .
the science is clear .
my favorite and a real hero of mine is yak@@ ima can@@ ut@@ t .
we can do bigger car stunts than ever before now .
i sort of forget how bizarre some of those conversations are .
two stunt guys doing what i consider to be a rather ben@@ ign stunt .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s that shape because the heli@@ um has to expand .
it took me a while ; it took me years to find the right balloon team to build the balloon that would do this job .
i contacted a company in the states who make suits for nasa .
this is a very lightweight suit . it weighs about 15 pounds .
but if you are , and you say to somebody , you know , they say , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; what do you do ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
do you remember the story ? no , it was big .
in fact , we moved from strat@@ ford to los angeles .
why not ? i think this is rather important .
so the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas .
in fact , creativity -- which i define as the process of having original ideas that have value -- more often than not comes about through the interaction of different disciplinary ways of seeing things .
i said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; what happened ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
now is the time for us to laugh at ourselves , before others can laugh with us .
so i retreated back to my cave and continued to support and produce comedy and let my friends use my couch as a regional operations hub .
so everywhere we went , we audi@@ tioned amateur@@ s .
one : is the middle east being shown in a current time and correct context ?
early detection , early intervention , that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the story for these successes .
fifty percent will have onset by age 14 , 75 percent by age 24 , a picture that is very different than what one would see if you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re talking about cancer or heart disease , diabetes , hyper@@ tension -- most of the major illnesses that we think about as being sources of morbi@@ dity and mortality .
the important piece here is that as you begin to look at people who have these disorders , the one in five of us who struggle in some way , you find that there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a lot of variation in the way that the brain is wired , but there are some predictable patterns , and those patterns are risk factors for developing one of these disorders .
but this tells us how we need to think about it , and where we need to go .
how many children will you get ?
but how wrong it is .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s very interesting . when we started our school the parents would give thum@@ b@@ prints in the attendance register .
there they met children who are with a different standard and a different mindset , a totally different society .
is it the exposure ? we have professors from mit , berkeley , stanford , indian institute of science who come and teach our children lots of scientific formulas , experiments , much beyond the classroom .
when i started pari@@ kr@@ ma i began with a great deal of arrogan@@ ce of transforming the world .
now that sounds like an incredibly straightforward question to answer , and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what howard thought . because pep@@ si told him , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; look , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re working with a band between eight and 12 percent .
you should be looking for the perfect pep@@ sis . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
every concei@@ vable way you can vary spaghetti sauce , he varied spaghetti sauce .
what howard did is he fundamentally changed the way the food industry thinks about making you happy .
much more volatile brown mustard seed , some white wine , a nose hit , much more delicate arom@@ atics . and what do they do ?
and she serves it that way time and time again , and if you quar@@ rel with her , she will say , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; you know what ? you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re wrong ! this is the best way it ought to be in this restaurant . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
if i were to ask all of you to try and come up with a brand of coffee -- a type of coffee , a brew -- that made all of you happy , and then i asked you to rate that coffee , the average score in this room for coffee would be about 60 on a scale of 0 to 100 .
we have pre-@@ cancer@@ ous lesions , which often don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t turn into cancer .
if you develop a disease , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re off the island .
it was when i became a journalist that i really realized how i was part of this problem , and how we all are part of this problem .
so , dad graduated harvard in 1946 , married my mom , and bought a house in lex@@ ington , massachusetts , where the first shots were fired against the british in 17@@ 75 , although we didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t actually hit any of them until con@@ cord .
and , yeah , we can look back in retrospe@@ ct and say , yeah , ha@@ -@@ ha , you know -- it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s all micro@@ film . but that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s -- that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not the point . he understood the shape of the future .
and if you go on the diag@@ onal , you get content and form -- and then beauty and truth .
so i wrote a book about this in &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; 93 , but as i was finishing the book , i had to do a little bit of ty@@ pe@@ setting , and i was tired of going to my local copy shop to do it , so i bought a computer .
we could do circular narratives that were literally circular .
why is this important ?
now maybe that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s been obvious to all of you for a long time , but for me , as often as i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d encountered that exact difficulty on a daily basis , i had never seen the inherent challenge of communication in so cryst@@ all@@ ine a light .
and the key detail of this is that fe@@ y &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s scripts weren &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t written by her and they weren &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t written by the snl writers .
because from what i can tell , the three things gay americans seem to want most are to join the military , get married and start a family .
but it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s when you put all of these elements together -- when you get the viral appeal of a great joke with a powerful pun@@ ch@@ line that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s crafted from honesty and integrity , it can have a real world impact at changing a conversation .
that is a lot of punch for 14 words .
how far back does that go ? how far back does modern language go ?
it reaches up to almost 5,000 pounds -- on a diet of j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish , primarily .
they school as adolescents , and become behe@@ moth lon@@ ers as adults .
so the great thing about the mol@@ a is that when we put the tag on them -- if you look up here -- that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s streaming off , that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s right where we put the tag .
and they come and give the mol@@ as -- you can see they strike this funny little position that says , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m not threatening , but i need a massage . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
but also what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s important is that they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re not sla@@ cker , lazy fish .
it was a 200-@@ foot diameter geo@@ desi@@ c sphere to be suspended over the east river in new york city , in full view of the united nations .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got a little video to show you , but keep in mind that this is with no electronic control , and this is also with only four le@@ ds .
how does it feel to see someone like this come along taking your art and doing so much with it ?
he realized at once what had happened .
so , have we all become one-@@ eyed -- two-@@ eyed instead of one-@@ eyed -- monkeys ?
and then aboriginal women in africa would come and say , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; this is it ! &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
i have a solution that requires neither machine , nor wood , nor cooking gas .
your parents were peaceful people .
hello governments of rich countries selling arms to governments of poor countries who can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t even afford to give them food .
her father the king said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t whistle . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
&@@ quo@@ t@@ ; u@@ h-@@ hu@@ h ... &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; she said .
and leibni@@ z was the first person to really talk about building such a machine .
von neumann , and a logi@@ cian , and a mathemati@@ cian from the army put this together . then , they needed a place to build it .
so , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s 40 of these tubes , like a v-@@ 40 engine running the memory .
&@@ quo@@ t@@ ; mani@@ ac regained its memory , when the power went off . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; machine or human ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
this now is the third different output .
so he designed this universe , and ran it .
and it was his universe on punch cards .
and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the end .
look at homicide at the bottom , for god &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s sake .
i went to west virginia , the most unhealthy state in america .
you see , the thing is obesity and die@@ t-@@ related disease doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t just hurt the people that have it ; it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s all of their friends , families , brothers , sisters .
now it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s largely processed and full of all sorts of addi@@ tives , extra ingredients , and you know the rest of the story .
normal . let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s get on schools , something that i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m fairly much a specialist in .
they have sci@@ ss@@ ors in the classroom , but knives and for@@ ks ? no .
i want to talk about something so basic as milk .
this , all this bad news , is preventable .
so , these guys are going to be part of the solution .
huntington &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s kitchen . huntington , where i made this program , you know , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got this prime-@@ time program that hopefully will inspire people to really get on this change .
dy@@ sle@@ xi@@ c , so i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m a bit slow .
in fact , a friend of mine from the security industry told me the other day that there are two types of companies in the world : those that know they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve been hacked , and those that don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t .
they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re completely anonymous , as it were .
and that challenge is : how do you do business , how do you trust somebody on the web who you want to do business with when you know that they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re a criminal ?
now he developed his social and moral compass on the black sea port during the 1990s .
and this man with a planet@@ ary-@@ sized brain is now serving a 13-@@ year sentence in california .
thank you very much for listening .
public health is another reason to consider retro@@ fitting .
and the market research , consumer research , asking the boom@@ ers and gen y what it is they would like , what they would like to live in , tells us there is going to be a huge demand -- and we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re already seeing it -- for more urban lifestyles within subur@@ bia .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s been so successful , they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve now taken over the strip across the street .
this one is one of my favorites , bel@@ mar .
you want to also try to get more systemic transformation .
the first is to plan retro@@ fitting much more syste@@ mi@@ cally at the metropolitan scale .
but we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got to get the architecture better .
so i decided to talk to women about their vag@@ inas .
and she said things that really shocked me about her vag@@ ina -- that it was drie@@ d-up and finished and dead -- and i was kind of shocked .
and so in 1997 , i said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s get women together .
and i really love hearing about all these species at the bottom of the sea .
she went to ju@@ arez to take care of an ailing aunt , and over the course of it , she began to discover what was happening to the murdered and disappeared women of ju@@ arez .
but , being a vag@@ ina warrior , she kept going , and she kept committing herself to transforming consciousness .
well , it seems to me that this hungarian presence in my life is difficult to account for , but ultimately i as@@ cri@@ be it to an admiration for people with a complex moral awareness , with a heritage of guilt and defeat matched by defiance and bra@@ v@@ ado .
and then one day , it happened : he and his family were arrested and they were taken to a death house on the dan@@ u@@ be .
mr. tes@@ z@@ ler hired 16 men : eight white , eight black .
and into the slow , second movement , marked &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; ada@@ gio religi@@ oso , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; he incorporated the sounds of bird@@ song that he heard outside his window in what he knew would be his last spring ; he was imagining a future for her in which he would play no part .
and it was only at that moment , as we were sitting down to dinner , that i recognized the enor@@ mity of the risk i had created , because to bring these two titans , these two masters of the universe together -- it was like introducing mo@@ th@@ ra to god@@ z@@ illa over the skyline of tokyo .
and i -- no one else did , so i put up my hand , and i said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a bac@@ chan@@ al by t@@ iti@@ an . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and in about 1997 , the then-@@ director philippe de monte@@ bello gave me the go-ahead to organize an exhibition for 2002 . we normally have these very long le@@ ad-@@ in times .
and in this extraordinary setting , the costumes were like actors and ac@@ tresses , or living sculptures .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m working to try and break down that sense of that eli@@ tism .
but we take the severe ones , and we re@@ schedule the other ones the next day .
so we came up with these two rules .
so i went to russia , and my mother also , &@@ #@@ 9@@ 1@@ ; during the &@@ #@@ 93@@ ; time of &@@ #@@ 9@@ 1@@ ; the &@@ #@@ 93@@ ; soviet union .
and really when you think &@@ #@@ 9@@ 1@@ ; you &@@ #@@ 93@@ ; cannot do it , she will push you , and i can do it .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to take you on a 16-@@ minute trip on 72 percent of the planet , so buck@@ le up .
you know , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to do this , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to take it away from something else .
and like a living organis@@ m , you tear it open , it ble@@ eds its mol@@ ten blood , rises up to heal that wound from the asth@@ eno@@ sphere , har@@ dens , forms new tissue and moves later@@ ally .
so , we came up with multiple hypothe@@ ses : there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s little green people down there taking it ; there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s all sorts of things going on .
we stumbled on it , looking for some missing heat .
near that was methane . i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve never seen volcan@@ oes of methane .
fortunately , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve been able to convince congress .
this is a remote center at the university of washington .
thank you very much .
let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s talk about what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s suddenly possible .
since we opened the website in february , we now have 6@@ 40,000 students from 190 countries .
other students might be interested in a particular en@@ rich@@ ment topic that they want to pursue individually .
in addition to multiple choice and the kinds of short answer questions that you saw in the video , we can also grade math , mathemati@@ cal expressions as well as mathemati@@ cal deriv@@ ations .
which is not a level of service i have ever offered to my stanford students .
and finally , there was a population of students that were taught in a one-on-one instruction using a tut@@ or .
you can see , for example , that the achievement score almost doubles in this particular experiment .
kak@@ i king : playing &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; pink noise &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; on guitar
&@@ quo@@ t@@ ; learn the lin@@ gua fran@@ ca . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
emily levine : richard . what did i say ?
i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t know if you know this but -- maybe it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s different now , or maybe you were making a statement -- but in many hospital nur@@ series across the country , until very recently anyway , according to a book by jessica benjamin , the signs over the little boys cri@@ bs read , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m a boy , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; and the signs over the little girls cri@@ bs read , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a girl . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; yeah .
so this whole subje@@ ct-@@ object thing has relevance to humor in this way .
and i was sort of , as i was starting to analyze what exactly it is that i do , i read a book called &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; trick@@ ster makes this world , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; by lewis hyde .
if they had had an olympics in marty@@ r@@ dom , my grandmother would have lost on purpose .
this is what i tend to see almost more than contradi@@ ctions .
and the mother is elderly .
and i like to explore all the possibilities in the hope that you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll be on the wa@@ vel@@ eng@@ th of your audience .
there are really serious calam@@ ities staring us in the eye that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re in the same kind of denial about that we were about terrorism , and what could &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve happened on september 11 .
1995 , we found three . the count now is up to 80 -- we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re finding about two or three a month .
it wasn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t really a research report ; it was a scre@@ ed .
number seven : parti@@ cle acceler@@ ator mish@@ ap .
now , corn originated , we think , in mexico .
we need to learn how to repair and re@@ plen@@ ish the earth &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s o@@ zone layer .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve all learned what -- the kind of panic that can occur when an old disease re@@ ars its head , like anth@@ ra@@ x .
but galaxies are very violent places , and things can be spun out of orbit .
of more concern , i think , is the aster@@ oids that exist between mars and jupiter .
when the mission was over , they actually landed on the thing .
bas@@ ho was a brilliant man .
and these two war against one another almost continuously .
all right , let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s talk about another perspective on the importance of the oceans .
modeling : on the right hand side , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a very complex comput@@ ational model .
we are already laced up as if we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re in a fiber op@@ tic cor@@ set , if you like .
this is going to be much more powerful than having a single ship in a single location , then move to a new location .
we pump the fluid through one of these systems , and we press the button , and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s analyzed for the gen@@ omic character .
so we can bring an entirely new tele@@ presence to the world , throughout the ocean .
and i think that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s really what architecture is based on .
and yet that energy and power of architecture has driven an entire social and political space that these buildings occupy .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s like the old las vegas used to be .
our whole practice depends on computing .
and i do believe that this interaction with the history , with history that is often very difficult , to grapple with it , to create a position that is beyond our normal expectations and to create a critique .
so again , the unexpected which is also the raw .
and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not only our memory , but those who remember us , which means that architecture is not mute .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s about creating with minimal means something which can not be repeated , cannot be simu@@ lated in any other sphere .
compromise , if it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s artistic , if it is able to cope with its strategies -- and there is my first sketch and the last rendering -- it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not that far away .
that sort of overall sustainable energy problem is the biggest problem that we have to solve this century , independent of environmental concerns .
bruno bow@@ den , who &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s here , did that , broke the world recor@@ d.@@ em : congratulations .
by the end of this year , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll be able to drive from l.a. to new york just using the super@@ charger network , which charges at five times the rate of anything else .
what are you doing ?
you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re kind of building a new type of distributed utility .
would humanity become a space-@@ far@@ ing civilization ?
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s much like on a jet .
these projects are so -- paypal , solar@@ city , tesla , spacex , they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re so spectac@@ ul@@ arly different , they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re such ambitious projects at scale .
elon musk , i wish we had all day , but thank you so much for coming to ted .
i grew up her@@ ding , looking after our livestock -- goats , sheep and cattle .
because it was wartime , the british .@@ 303 rifle was just all over the whole country .
and thus , as people started feeling ownership over wildlife , wildlife numbers started coming back , and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s actually becoming a foundation for conservation in namibia .
the other partners that we have got is business communities .
in 2008 , con@@ servan@@ cy generated 5.7 million dollars .
it allows for us to celebrate the seafood that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re also so fortunate to eat .
well , how many bottles is it before you tell me that i have a problem ?
so i think we have this whole eating thing wrong .
they got more calories over the course of a diversified meal .
i remember well the meals of my childhood .
thank you .
and the great irony and tragedy of our time is that a lot of the general public thinks that science is still arguing about that .
similarly , a lot of art projects stay in the art community , and i feel very much a responsibility through mechanisms like ted , and like our relationship with the obama white house , with the senate , with john kerry , to influence policy as much as possible with these pictures as well .
you see the glacier flowing in from the right , dropping off into the sea , camera shooting every hour .
finally catches up to itself , it advances .
all those colors are ice and it goes up to about two miles thick , just a gigantic dome that comes in from the coast and rises in the middle .
but what we have is a perception problem because not enough people really get it yet .
the more polite ones said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; well , you know , indians make good software program@@ mers and accoun@@ tants , but they can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t do the creative stuff . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
they were working on truly global products , and companies like microsoft , google , astrazeneca , general electric , philips , have already answered in the affirmative the question that from their bangalore and hyderabad r &@@ amp@@ ; amp ; d centers they are able to produce products and services for the world .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not a new product or a new process but a new way to organize work , and the most significant management innovation to come out of india , invented by the indian off@@ shor@@ ing industry is what we call the global delivery model .
well , in 2010 , they decided they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re not going to reveal this data anymore , so i had to make some estimates based on various sources .
for a time that i find to be the most pla@@ cid and un@@ event@@ ful hour of the day , four in the morning sure gets an awful lot of bad press -- across a lot of different media from a lot of big names .
100 years to the day after the death of alfred nobel himself .
and then -- three paragra@@ phs later we get this little beauty : &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; we went back to blair house to look at the speech for the last time .
let me first address a few popular mis@@ con@@ ceptions .
and when that cellular space station is within the electric field , it acts on those highly charged proteins and alig@@ ns them .
the expected five year survival is less than five percent .
and a year after that treatment , his tumor grew back with a venge@@ ance .
i am the happiest , the happiest person in the world .
and i firmly believe that in the next 10 years tumor treating fields will be a weapon available to doctors and patients for all of these most-@@ difficul@@ t-to-@@ treat solid tumors .
and you can notice they have created a kind of false cat@@ chment .
the age is 400 years .
we had full-@@ page advertisements , some 30 years , 25 years ago when this canal came .
and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a kind of water body for all seasons .
and they have dubbed this water as the third one called &@@ #@@ 9@@ 1@@ ; unclear &@@ #@@ 93@@ ; .
three sides , such steps , on the fourth side there is a four-@@ story building where you can organize such ted conferences anytime .
these artifacts and designs are inspiring .
it doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t matter if this is the jung@@ les of singapore or the tun@@ dra of northern finland .
and they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re investing in tele@@ coms , shopping m@@ alls .
south africa is playing a role .
how do you get from poverty and corruption to wealth and less corruption ?
and then something happened in 1980 .
invest .
but i think a much bigger problem with this is that this logic -- that we should be dropping i@@ pods not bombs -- i mean , it would make a fascinating title for thomas friedman &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s new book .
instead of trying to pur@@ ge these comments , they instead went and reached out to the blog@@ gers .
right ? so they can go online and contribute ideas on what that region would look like by the year 2020 .
so what should we do about it ?
explain to me what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s wrong .
no , the boy said to me -- the boy said to me , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; it would destroy me . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
they called me anthony growing up as a kid .
we had a whole choice of inappropriate names for her .
the world i en@@ vision for her -- how do i want men to be acting and behaving ?
soft power is a concept invented by a harvard academic , joseph n@@ ye , a friend of mine .
but sometimes it just sat there .
farmers now , who used to have to spend half a day of back@@ breaking labor to find out if the market town was open , if the market was on , whether the product they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d harve@@ sted could be sold , what price they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d fetch .
they had to suspend functions at 8 : 30 .
and to this day remains the only jewish diaspora in the history of the jewish people , which has never encountered a single incident of anti-semit@@ ism .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the idea of an ever-@@ ever-@@ land , emerging from an ancient civilization , united by a shared history , but sustained , above all , by plur@@ alist democracy .
tra@@ ch@@ oma is an infection of the eye due to dirt can leave you permanently blind .
and another key thing that i learned a lot throughout this whole process , last year google named me as one of the brightest young minds in the world .
so probably it doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t matter 50 years from now -- stre@@ pto@@ co@@ c@@ cus and stuff like that will be rampant -- because we won &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t be here . but if we are -- we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to need something to do with the bacteria .
mission accomplished !
there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s nothing intrinsi@@ cally sweet about honey .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s important that we love babies , and that we not be put off by , say , messy dia@@ pers .
and he liked to do an exercise with his students where he got them to take a piece of paper and draw the person who sat next to them , their neighbor , very quickly , just as quickly as they could .
maybe have the same kind of security to play .
thank you . all right .
so we have the finger bla@@ sters . other people have dinosaurs , you know .
yeah , thought so . so we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve all seen it , haven &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t we ?
great . cool . so i was really interested in quantity .
so it was a pretty successful evening .
construction play -- it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s playful , obviously , but also a powerful way to learn .
and of course , by the time you get to the average workplace , maybe the best construction tool we have might be the post-@@ it notes . it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s pretty barren .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve gone through lots of experiences in life , and they provide a strong intu@@ ition as to whether an interaction is going to work .
in short , we admire their willingness to play .
perhaps in conver@@ gent mode we need to be more serious .
reaching success , i was pretty good at coming up with good ideas .
so they took their money and their projects to others who would serve them better .
to be more accurate , i wanted to be a pop star .
i had learned to read music by then , or slowly learning to read music .
this is cheryl ang from singapore .
and i had the same reaction you did .
&@@ quo@@ t@@ ; my sister and i used to sing in cho@@ irs together constantly .
you can imagine , with 2,000 syn@@ chroni@@ zed youtube videos , the render time is just atro@@ cious .
this here is nissan &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s my@@ leaf , where your driving behavior is compared with the driving behavior of other people , so you can compete for who drives around the most fuel efficiently .
they want us to fit in even better .
and that is an idea that , i think , that paul richard buchanan nicely put in a recent essay where he said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; products are vivid arguments about how we should live our lives . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
workers are treated as well or as badly as the workers were treated who built that chair . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
in fact , i use basically the same technology as this 14@@ th-century classroom .
and i like that kind of response .
so what have we learned ?
so , a quick strike like that . and if we slow it down a bit , this is the man@@ tis shrimp -- the same species -- recorded at 1,000 frames a second , played back at 15 frames per second .
i hope there aren &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t any sna@@ il rights activists around here .
it just looks like a sad@@ dle you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d put on a horse .
in biological systems it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s important not to have a whole lot of extra material requirements for building it .
the first peak , obviously , is the lim@@ b hitting the load cell .
and these animals may very well be making use of not only the force and the energy stored with that specialized spring , but the extremes of the fluid dynamics . and they might actually be making use of fluid dynamics as a second force for breaking the sna@@ il .
biologist sheila p@@ atek talks about her work measuring the feeding strike of the man@@ tis shrimp , one of the fastest movements in the animal world , using video cameras recording at 20,000 frames per second .
it turns out that something more than 94 percent of life on earth is aqu@@ atic .
now , go into the real atmosphere of this planet .
i put reverse thrust and i try and pull gently down .
i come back up , not for air .
so anybody who wants to copy us and come and join us , go for it .
there are problems of sewage over@@ flow and contamination , but i would also argue that almost every city has this exact condition , and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a condition that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re all facing .
what is fu@@ zzy rope , you ask ?
and the answer is : not yet , they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re working .
we had to get rid of the smell .
and eventually snow made a map of the outbreak .
so that in one generation , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to hal@@ ve our cultural diversity .
so , two months later , i went into tibet , and i started interviewing the people there , taking my photographs . that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what i do .
this is another leader of his people .
so it was a great experience for him . he stayed up all night with them , dru@@ mming and dancing .
and just this last year we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve taken a group of teenagers in , and this has worked the best .
and so , i have my first slide to talk about the daw@@ ning of the universe and what i call the cosmic scene investigation , that is , looking at the reli@@ cs of creation and infer@@ ring what happened at the beginning , and then following it up and trying to understand it .
and then i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to show you it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s actually a lot more complicated .
and then there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a part of the universe we can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t see because it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s so dense and so hot , light can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t escape .
they go out and point a telescope at the sky , take a picture , identify what are stars and throw them away , look at the galaxies , estimate how far away they are , and plot them up .
and so now we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re in for some serious play .
so we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re zo@@ oming in .
so the question is , how hard would it be to assemble this , right ?
that pulls in more material and pulls in more material .
at serious play 2008 , astro@@ physi@@ cist george smo@@ ot shows stunning new images from deep-@@ space surveys , and pro@@ ds us to pon@@ der how the cosmos -- with its giant we@@ bs of dark matter and mysterious gap@@ ing voi@@ ds -- got built this way .
you get stressed , you do some meditation .
we need an exercise . we need a framework to learn how to be more mindful .
it does hurt . and we reinforce the storyline , right ?
and he actually took one look at my squ@@ ig@@ gly line , and said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; well , why don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t you just embrace the shake ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
what if i could only create with a dollar &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s worth of supplies ?
it did not happen overnight .
so i was filming .
and when i made my way to that pi@@ ping chim@@ ney i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d seen in the distance , i saw hanna za@@ vor@@ ot@@ n@@ ya , and i met her .
i have a deeper connection to my laptop than any bit of soil .
i em@@ body the central paradox .
parents text and do email at breakfast and at dinner while their children complain about not having their parents &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; full attention .
but what might feel just right for that middle-aged executive can be a problem for an adolescent who needs to develop face-to-face relationships .
that feeling that no one is listening to me is very important in our relationships with technology .
and we are vulnerable .
so what do we do ? we connect more and more .
make room for it .
let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s talk about how we can use digital technology , the technology of our dreams , to make this life the life we can love .
the master said , &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; tho@@ u did@@ st thy best , that is success . &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; from those things , and one other perhaps , i co@@ ined my own definition of success , which is : peace of mind at@@ tained only through self-@@ satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to do the best of which you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re capable .
i knew him once , but then he was a boy .
and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not good , for a young married man to go home in a bad mood .
i think our tendency is to hope that things will turn out the way we want them to much of the time . but we don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t do the things that are necessary to make those things become reality .
and you can win when you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re outscor@@ ed .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve had some that could and wouldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t , and i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve had some that would and couldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t .
in fact , in the last 10 years , the number of patients requiring an organ has doubled , while in the same time , the actual number of transplan@@ ts has barely gone up .
liver cells , nerve cells , pancre@@ atic cells -- we still can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t grow them even today .
we then place it in an o@@ ven@@ -like device , and we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re able to create that structure and bring it out .
and then finally you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re able to get that structure out .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s actually the actual prin@@ ter right now , and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s been printing this kidney structure that you see here .
i became the captain of the team , and that was great .
i pulled them aside .
the other week , i went on one of these sites , appropriately called swap@@ tree , and there were over 5@@ 9,@@ 300 items that i could instantly swap for my copy of &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; 24 . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what happened to me when i noticed that we are moving from passive consumers to creators , to highly enabled collaborators .
these four drivers are fu@@ sing together and creating the big shift -- away from the 20th century , defined by hyper-@@ consumption , towards the 21st century , defined by collaborative consumption .
these three systems are coming together , allowing people to share resources without sacrifi@@ cing their lifestyles , or their cherished personal freedoms .
this is fueling a massive shift from where usage trumps possessions -- or as kevin kelly , the editor of wired magazine , puts it , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; where access is better than ownership . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
my name is joseph , a member of parliament in kenya .
the leader of the chiefs said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; no , sorry . we can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t take you . you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll slow us down .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m asking my friends from america to help with bringing nurses or doctors to help us out .
so i was in the museum of science at the time the tornado hit , playing with the tornado display .
co : you got my number off the news ?
systems like the ones that we were creating on the fly could exist ahead of time .
mo : data .
in our hometown , we trained a half-@@ dozen residents to run these web tools on their own .
and i met julius the last week that i was living in ki@@ ber@@ a .
&@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ in case you owe one month , the landlord will come with his hen@@ ch@@ men and bundle you out . he will confisc@@ ate your things , &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; armstrong said .
this is perhaps the most pri@@ mit@@ i@@ ve shan@@ ty that you can find in ki@@ ber@@ a , little more than a sti@@ ck-@@ and-@@ mud hut next to a garbage heap .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s on very steep ground .
one is people need a guarantee they won &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t be evi@@ cted .
the future of these communities is in the people and in our ability to work with those people .
i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t know where julian mor@@ row got that from .
see it up there ?
one is another american invent@@ or ted h@@ enter .
many websites we can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t read using ja@@ ws and the other technologies .
i think i have to say goodbye now .
interestingly enough , other neuro@@ logic diseases which affect very different parts of the brain also show tang@@ les of mis@@ folded protein , which suggests that the approach might be a general one , and might be used to cure many neuro@@ logic diseases , not just alzheimer &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s disease .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to ignore their cau@@ tions and make one very specific forecast .
so this is a time of great flouri@@ shing , and the more i look around , the more convinced i become that this quote , from the physi@@ cist freeman dyson , is not hyper@@ b@@ ole at all .
and to make them really stereo@@ typical , let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s make them both white guys .
and if you find yourself worried that something like a guaranteed income is going to stif@@ le our drive to succeed and make us kind of compla@@ cent , you might be interested to know that social mobility , one of the things we really pride ourselves on in the united states , is now lower than it is in the northern european countries that have these very generous social safety nets .
the realities of this new machine age and the change in the economy are becoming more widely known .
i have become more and more uncomfortable with this perception of god over the years .
some have concluded that we can only believe in a god who shares our pain .
in the second verse comes the line , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; the wind and waves o@@ bey him . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
so who is god , if not the great pu@@ ppe@@ t-@@ master or the tribal prote@@ ctor ?
what if god is in things ?
how could one practice such a faith ?
and so , i want to kind of go through my little story of what i found out .
and if we study those h@@ unter-@@ gather@@ er tribes and the neander@@ thal , which are very similar to early man , we find out a very curious thing about this world without technology , and this is a kind of a curve of their average age .
it was sort of , in a certain sense , in a m@@ clu@@ han sense , an external stomach , in the sense that it was cooking food that we could not eat otherwise .
while this is something that comes from our mind , it also has its roots deeply into the cosmos .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a bran@@ ching off from the human form .
i think that really leads nowhere .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what we get from technology all the time . that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s why people leave villages and go into cities , is because they are always gravit@@ ating towards increased choices and possibilities .
meanwhile , i had grown up around a lot of teachers .
so the idea was that we would be working on whatever we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re working on , at 2 : 30 p.m. the students flow in and you put down what you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re doing , or you trade , or you work a little bit later or whatever it is .
that was just my one thing -- i said we had to have something that drops on people &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s heads .
and we found ourselves full every day with kids .
the key thing is , even if you only have a couple of hours a month , those two hours shoul@@ der-@@ to-@@ shoulder , next to one student , concentrated attention , shining this beam of light on their work , on their thoughts and their self-@@ expression , is going to be absolutely transformative , because so many of the students have not had that ever before .
they work under the teacher &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s guide , and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s all in one big room .
and so then they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re all sold in the store . this is near the plan@@ ks .
they didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t want to sell pir@@ ate supplies .
so this is the space during tut@@ oring hours .
anyway . so i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to jump ahead .
the schools need you . the teachers need you .
you see , i grew up in war-torn iraq , and i believe that there are two sides of wars and we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve only seen one side of it .
this is where we concei@@ ve of rape and casualties as inevit@@ abilities .
there is a side that fights , and there is a side that keeps the schools and the factories and the hospitals open .
a con@@ golese woman , who was telling me about how her children saw their father killed in front of them and saw her raped in front of them and mu@@ ti@@ lated in front of them , and her children saw their nine-year-old sibling killed in front of them , how they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re doing okay right now .
za@@ in@@ ab sal@@ bi : women , wartime and the dream of peace
and she has this show , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; the simple life . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
last month , i was at google , and , boy , that caf@@ eter@@ ia , man .
and she &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s very important in my life , because she &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the one that told me to leave mit and go to art school .
so if you compare complexities to simplicity , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s also catching up in a way , too .
and when you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re told this , you feel kind of weird .
so , i went back to the computer , and i bought five large fries , and scan@@ ned them all . and i was looking for some kind of food theme , and i wrote some software to automatically lay out french-@@ fry images .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a bit eerie , isn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t it ?
this book i wrote because i want to figure out life .
and this is the fourth time , and i come here for this wisdom , i think .
environmental challenges fall into the same three categories , and most of what we think about are local environmental problems : air pollution , water pollution , hazardous waste dum@@ ps . but there are also regional environmental problems , like acid rain from the midwest to the northeast , and from western europe to the arctic , and from the midwest out the mississippi into the dead zone of the gulf of mexico .
you all know that . at the last ipcc summary , the scientists wanted to say , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; how certain are you ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; they wanted to answer that &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; 99 percent . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
we have to have a unified view of how to go about this : the struggle against poverty in the world and the challenge of cutting wealthy country emissions , all has a single , very simple solution .
what we need is another hero generation . those of us who are alive in the united states of america today especially , but also the rest of the world , have to somehow understand that history has presented us with a choice -- just as jill &@@ #@@ 9@@ 1@@ ; bol@@ te &@@ #@@ 93@@ ; taylor was figuring out how to save her life while she was distracted by the amazing experience that she was going through .
so they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re saying the right things and they may -- whichever of them is elected -- may do the right thing , but let me tell you : when i came back from kyo@@ to in 1997 , with a feeling of great happiness that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d gotten that breakthrough there , and then confronted the united states senate , only one out of 100 senators was willing to vote to confirm , to rati@@ fy that treaty . whatever the candidates say has to be laid alongside what the people say .
a change in commitment . a new sense of urgency .
and this exhibition is about the work of designers that help us be more ela@@ stic , and also of designers that really work on this ela@@ sti@@ city as an opportunity . and one last thing is that it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not only designers , but it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s also scientists .
he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s thinking -- of course it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s all a concept -- of inje@@ cting ty@@ pe@@ faces into sper@@ mat@@ o@@ zo@@ a , i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t know how to say it in english -- sper@@ mat@@ azo@@ i -- in order to make them become -- to almost have a song or a whole poem written with every e@@ jac@@ ulation .
in this particular case a section will be devoted to information design .
rapid manufacturing is a computer file sent directly from the computer to the manufacturing machine .
another shape is made for cancer .
and many designers have been working recently on the idea of death and mourning , and what we can do about it today with new technologies .
we did it in three steps .
and the same pattern emerged in each conflict .
so what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s going on ?
the opposite happened .
and within jewish teach@@ ings , the rabb@@ ini@@ c teach@@ ings , we have hil@@ le@@ l , who taught that you shouldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t do to others what you don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t like being done to yourself .
and then god looked to the future and realized , if the world was created just with justice , the world couldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t exist .
and that unity is something that connects all of creation .
and he rushed home . and after the sab@@ bath , he made 12 lo@@ aves of bread , took them to the synagogue , went into the synagogue , opened the ark and said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; god , i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t know why you want this bread , but here you are . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and he called the two of them to his office .
it persists for months and of@@ ten@@ times for years , and when that happens , it is its own disease .
but the worst part was , not the spontaneous pain that was there 24 hours a day .
we treat these patients in a rather crude fashion at this point in time .
if you look out your window and you can see long &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s peak , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re probably familiar with it .
so it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s about a mile across , 600 feet deep .
let me note that we have not had a giant impact like the dinosau@@ r-@@ killer for 65 million years . they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re very rare .
now the good news is that the odds of it actually passing through this key@@ hole and hitting us next go-@@ around are one in a million , roughly -- very , very low odds , so i personally am not lying awake at night worrying about this at all .
and there are a lot of other problems with that . it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s very hard to do .
this probe actually can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t use chemical rockets .
so i thought that it will be good to start with it .
and we all had all of that on tapes .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s so obvious , straight in your face , and somebody must have thought of it .
you see banks -- i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t know if there are any bankers over here ; i apologize in advance -- but it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the best job in the world .
just quickly on the results .
he goes and sees the governor . the governor says , boris nikol@@ aye@@ vich , i understand you are doing a great job , and you are the most respected newspaper in our district .
because when you think about the importance , some of the issues that we were talking about last night -- this last session we had about africa and his hypothetical 50 billion dollars destined for africa .
now we do day@@ dreaming in 11 : 30 with 55 seconds left .
what happens to matter if you chop it up very fine ?
and suppose they have , you know , very different sensory apparatus , and so on .
and in a lot of familiar cases , they of course are .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a very simple example .
now , here is a very exciting development that many people have not heard of .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the same theory of gravity .
presumably , they mean something supernatural .
how true for lincoln .
so then he surprised the nation with an upset victory for the presidency over three far more experienced , far more educated , far more celebrated rivals .
but even in his wil@@ dest dreams , lincoln could never have imagined how far his reputation would reach .
but it was not to be that simple .
a victor in a thousand contests , three great civil rights laws , medicare , aid to education .
one of his favorite stories , for example , had to do with the revolutionary war hero , ethan allen .
and i was so excited -- first person i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d ever see outside of eb@@ bets field .
but luckily , my first confession -- to a base@@ ball-@@ loving priest !
and i want to begin with one episode from that sequence of events that most of you would be very familiar with , bel@@ sh@@ az@@ zar &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s feast -- because we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re talking about the iran-@@ iraq war of 5@@ 39 bc .
and what is the great king , the powerful king , the king of the four quarters of the world going to do ?
it was the largest empire the world had known until then .
no other evidence .
and equally , he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d have been surprised that he was acting under orders from mar@@ du@@ k .
they want to borrow the cyrus cy@@ linder .
and i want to finish by asking you what the next story will be in which this object figures .
and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s only when it goes wrong that we start to realize the importance of families to children .
for those without disabilities , at age three , they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re transferred to another institution , and at age seven , to yet another . segreg@@ ated according to age and gender , they are arbitr@@ arily separated from their siblings , often without even a chance to say goodbye .
people need to know the harm that institutions cause to children , and the better alternatives that exist .
because it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s obviously incredibly frightening .
and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s why we wanted it to be the 21st of september as the date of peace .
and just staying in the moment with it was a beautiful thing and really empowering actually .
it didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t matter if it didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t create a day of peace .
and i remember thinking , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; this is exactly why , actually , we have to work even harder .
it was historical . could it work in afghanistan with un@@ ama and who and civil society , etc . , etc . , etc . ?
and we did , and we traveled around , and we spoke to elders , we spoke to doctors , we spoke to nurses , we held press conferences , we went out with soldiers , we sat down with isa@@ f , we sat down with nato , we sat down with the u.k. government .
and we gave the film over .
ultimately , that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s about . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s about your constituencies ; it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s about your businesses .
but let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s play along .
so this to me became the important question to answer : how many neurons does the human brain have , and how does that compare to other animals ?
compared to a rat , we might seem special , yes , but that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not a fair comparison to make , given that we know that we are not ro@@ dents .
when you eat like a pri@@ mate , you can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t afford both .
and i think that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s how we got to become human .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m fascinated with the idea of what happens when you merge biology with technology , and i remember reading about this idea of being able to re@@ program biology , in the future , away from disease and aging .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a very logical plan , but it was not always like this .
but one day , something happened .
the man , his name was mahmoud , and the child , whose name was ra@@ fi , left .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not a priority . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
the stump or cast pros@@ thesis was made , and he was starting the real physical rehabilitation .
no need of staying with me all the day pushing my wheelchair . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t want them to be teased at school by the other students . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
but with naj@@ mud@@ din , we cannot discuss .
they are 7,000 every year -- people coming for the first time .
this is my big wish .
i want to tell you some stories that explain my view .
their decisions , their actions matter .
what lessons would you take from an experience like this ?
and i was part of that .
now , i was a little scared because when you see those three problems , they seem really hard to deal with .
and he signs off , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; thank you . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
it says a lot about her peers who elected her .
can you see it ?
so when we want to learn whether a planet is hab@@ itable , whether it might be am@@ enable to life , we want to know not only how much total light it receives and how warm it is , but we want to know about its space weather -- this high-@@ energy radiation , the uv and the x-@@ rays that are created by its star and that ba@@ the it in this bath of high-@@ energy radiation .
wrong . i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m not looking at you . i can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t see you .
but there exists out there a very large population of people who will tell you that they have psychi@@ c , magical powers that they can predict the future , that they can make contact with the deceased .
she doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t bring any useful information to us .
&@@ quo@@ t@@ ; did he ever have an electric razor ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; no . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
now , without that , how could we possibly function ?
she couldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t reach me . now she says she doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t want to reach me because i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m a go@@ dless person .
now folks , this is not just a metaphor i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to give you now , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s true .
those are very important , critically important to us .
legendary skep@@ tic james ran@@ di takes a fatal dose of home@@ opath@@ ic sleeping pills onstage , kicking off a sear@@ ing 18-@@ minute indictment of irrational beliefs . he throws out a challenge to the world &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s psychi@@ cs : prove what you do is real , and i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll give you a million dollars .
so it runs frequently , the entire hospital , just on a generator .
there has to be something better . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
but this gives control to the provider , whether there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s power or not , because they can adjust the flow based on the percentage of oxygen they see that they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re giving their patient .
but we still want to be sure that this is the most effective and safe device that we can be putting into hospitals .
some logos designed by my students .
the creative spirit in africa , the creative tradition , is as potent as it has always been , if only designers could look within .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a holocaust of a different kind , and hiding under our desks isn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t going to help .
now , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here , but the evidence is that plants -- and i want to make this clear -- it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not the ingredients in plants , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the plants .
half the people who developed the food pyramid have ties to agri@@ business .
margar@@ ine didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t exist .
the effects of this are well known . they are everywhere .
most moms cooked like mine : a piece of bro@@ iled meat , a quickly made salad with bottled dressing , canned soup , canned fruit salad .
leading the way -- what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s leading the way ?
and i say this as a man who has eaten a fair share of cor@@ ned beef in his life .
we can continue the search for the ingredients we love , and we can continue to spin yar@@ ns about our favorite meals .
sound familiar ?
if i can ask an indi@@ scre@@ et question , how many of you have tattoos ?
myth number two : or@@ phe@@ us , wonderful guy , charming to be around , great parti@@ er , great singer , loses his beloved , char@@ ms his way into the under@@ world , only person to charm his way into the under@@ world , char@@ ms the gods of the under@@ world , they release his beauty on the condition he never look at her until they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re out .
some of these have already been touched upon by other speakers , which is encouraging .
52 million people die of natural causes each year correspon@@ ds , then , to 52 million volumes destroyed .
if we were to take into account future generations that will never come into existence if we blow ourselves up , then the figure becomes astronomical .
we were very successful .
so if you think about what it means to learn ari@@ th@@ me@@ tic or to learn to read , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re actually , literally re@@ writing your own brain .
and they would just stare at us with baf@@ fle@@ ment when we spend time listening to a beautiful performance , like the one we just heard -- because of people making stupid movements , and they would be really irrit@@ ated and wouldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t see what we were up to .
so then , you move off to this larger sphere of &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; human + , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; and you could continue that process and eventually explore a lot of this larger space of possible modes of being .
ts : those are permanent magne@@ ts , yeah .
ts : yeah , well let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s put a couple of can@@ v@@ ases .
and then when i did the second one , it really disturbed the piece -- these big blue lines crashing through the center of it -- and so it created a kind of tension and an overlap .
you know , it seems at this stage in your life , you also very personally are in this state of confrontation with a sort of diss@@ on@@ ant -- i suppose it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s an electro@@ magnetic force that somehow govern@@ s your parkinson &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s and this creative force that is both the artist who is in the here and now and this sort of arc of your whole life .
ts : thank you , john .
my mother comes out , and he asks her for money , but she doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t have enough .
i grew up in the middle of nowhere on a dirt road in rural arkansas , an hour from the nearest movie theater .
one of them , i call my mi@@ ma@@ w &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s test .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m under the river with those fish .
one of these is scrat@@ ch-@@ off master@@ pieces .
what he did was to get wild birds to make his art for him .
and so we got to the grave and made this , which was hilarious -- the attention that we got .
and also they reference how the u@@ vul@@ a -- everything they say is fallen because of the forbidden fruit .
he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s an australian aboriginal elder , and he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s also an artist .
and you would think that should have nothing to do with one another , but i hope by the end of these 18 minutes , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll see a little bit of a relation .
and what changed is something you might not have expected in an art , which is math .
and if you don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t want to fold 400 scales , you can back off and just do a few things , and add plates to the back of a turtle , or toes .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to learn how to make one fla@@ p .
and i can use those patterns now to create orig@@ ami shapes .
toes have become an orig@@ ami meme , because everyone &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s doing it .
they certainly didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t need to talk to orig@@ ami artists .
the problem that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s being solved here is something that needs to be big and she@@ et-@@ like at its destination , but needs to be small for the journey .
forrest north : the beginning of any collaboration starts with a conversation .
he came up with our name and logo . we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re mission motors .
the 200@@ ,@@ 000-@@ year period in which men have been top dog is truly coming to an end , believe it or not , and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s why i talk about the &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; end of men . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and so they decided , because they were intrigued by this finding , to do a nationwide survey .
but that really isn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t true anymore .
and what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s even more disturbing is what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s happening with younger boys .
and i think the reason it has a sting is because thousands of years of history don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t reverse themselves without a lot of pain , and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s why i talk about us all going through this together .
but over the &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; 70s and &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; 80s , the south korea government decided they wanted to rapidly industri@@ alize , and so what they did was , they started to push women into the workforce .
and we have a lot of skill and experience , but it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a trick , so how are you supposed to prepare to get through that glass ceiling ?
and the man who talked at that evening lecture was very interesting .
and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s interesting , if you think about it , how , when we think about the civili@@ zations that we look up to as having been pinn@@ ac@@ les of human achievement -- whether it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s china , greece , the hindu civilization , or the may@@ as , or egyp@@ ti@@ ans -- what we know about them is really about their ec@@ sta@@ sies , not about their everyday life .
whether it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s mathematics or music , it takes that long to be able to begin to change something in a way that it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s better than what was there before .
you know that what you need to do is possible to do , even though difficult , and sense of time disappe@@ ars , you forget yourself , you feel part of something larger .
even though sometimes watching television about seven to eight percent of the time is in flow , but that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s when you choose a program you really want to watch and you get feedback from it .
and if &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; where do you come from ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and the number of us who live outside the old nation@@ -@@ state categories is increasing so quickly , by 64 million just in the last 12 years , that soon there will be more of us than there are americans .
and yet , there is one great problem with movement , and that is that it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s really hard to get your bear@@ ings when you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re in mi@@ da@@ ir .
and i sat down , and i began to write , and write , and write , even though i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d gone there really to get away from my desk .
thank you .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to talk now about how world population has changed from that year and into the future , but i will not use digital technology , as i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve done during my first five ted@@ talks .
and the most successful of the developing countries , they have moved on , you know , and they have become emerging economies , we call them .
will they move on ?
the whole emerging world joins the western world with good child survival and small family size , but we still have the poorest billion .
the world &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s population will grow to 9 billion over the next 50 years -- and only by raising the living standards of the poorest can we check population growth . this is the parado@@ xi@@ cal answer that hans ros@@ ling unvei@@ ls at ted @ cannes using colorful new data display technology .
we are left with this missing space of increased deaths the further north you go .
and i started doing research , and we found , very exc@@ it@@ ingly , that the skin produces nit@@ ric oxide .
now , what we were careful to do was , vitamin d is made by ultra@@ violet b rays and we wanted to separate our story from the vitamin d story .
there is no change in blood flow , in di@@ lat@@ ation of the blood vessels .
and this is ongoing work , but dermat@@ ologists -- i mean , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m a dermat@@ ologist .
these are major issues .
so , your body is constantly regener@@ ating .
it disin@@ te@@ gr@@ ates a few months later .
and this is an x-ray showing you the patent , functional blood vessel .
but there are other hollow organs that have added complexity to it .
another strategy that we have followed is actually to use dec@@ el@@ lu@@ lari@@ zed organs .
we are limited with distances right now , but our goal is actually to increase those distances over time .
he finally stops the runaway stage .
i would be willing to bet that i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m the dum@@ best guy in the room because i couldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t get through school . i struggled with school .
what we do is we sit and teach our kids all the things they shouldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t do : don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t hit ; don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t bite ; don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t swear .
all three of the founders of ne@@ ts@@ cape had it .
is it thing one or thing two ? what is it ?
and i remember this one customer so vivi@@ dly because i also did some other stuff with these clients .
i also learned , don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t reveal your source , because i got beat up after about four weeks of doing this because one of the rich kids found out where i was buying my comics from , and he didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t like the fact that he was paying a lot more .
and you could stuff pins in them .
then i would go up and deliver them to these 70@@ -year-old women playing bridge .
that was cool because then i had retail outlets .
and then they don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t have a regular check , but they have more opportunities to find more stuff , and they learn the skill of negotiating , and they learn the skill of finding opportunities as well .
if you go into a restaurant and you have bad customer service , show them what bad customer service looks like .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a video that was done by one of the companies that i mentor .
we have even managed to make the study of literature ar@@ cane .
a harrowing predi@@ le@@ ction for the uses of force had become commonplace , with an equal di@@ sta@@ ste for the alternative forms of influence .
but structures designed to connect , rather than divide mutually dependent circles , rather than isolating tri@@ angles .
the most important discovery we made in our focus on public action was to appreciate that the hard choices are not between good and evil , but between competing goods .
president obama and his team simply cannot do it alone .
okay , see ? it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s done . it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s almost done . here we go .
they recognize : both of these things have to live together .
they are acting in the sense that they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re e@@ mu@@ lating the original mas@@ h@@ up .
in the good old days when this republican ran that company , their greatest work was work that built on the past , right .
now , i think there are lessons we should learn here , lessons about openness .
you could still buy the music , but you couldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t hear anything because it had been silenced .
anyway , please join me in teaching these values .
if you don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t say the right creative thing , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to be judged .
and something else happened , these people who went through the process and touched the snake ended up having less anxiety about other things in their lives .
about that time he was at the d.@@ school at stanford taking classes .
so while you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re sitting around with the other patients in your pa@@ jamas and everybody &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s pale and thin and you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re waiting for your turn to get the gam@@ ma rays , you think of a lot of things .
thank you .
let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s take a look at what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s going on in different space types in this building .
when he met me and realized that it was possible for him to study in a quantitative way how his design choices impacted the ecology and biology of this building , he got really excited , because it added a new dimension to what he did .
so let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s just run through these guys .
the system was designed to au@@ gment human intelligence , it was called .
these are some examples of this system in action in the late 80s .
and according to fortune magazine , he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s worth 700 million dollars .
in fact , someone on reddit thought , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; oh , what a great thing , we should all vote this up . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
they even created an e-@@ card so you could send your friend a dancing sp@@ lash@@ y .
i am a native of burkina faso .
fundraising was not an easy task .
and for me and my community , this project was a huge success .
i would like to share with you this .
yes , you know it .
and when you look through them , you get a glimpse into the mind of the cyber-@@ illu@@ sion@@ ist .
voice : don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t tell , or it won &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t come true .
digital mt : this is without a question the real thing .
now the big question here is obviously , how do we make sense of china ?
the first is that the most important political value for the chinese is unity , is the maintenance of chinese civilization .
the chinese have a very , very different conception of race to most other countries .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s had no serious rivals .
so there we have three building blocks for trying to understand the difference that is china -- the civili@@ z@@ ation-@@ state , the notion of race and the nature of the state and its relationship to society .
first , the west is rapidly losing its influence in the world .
now this is the way things are going to move , because china has a very specific problem , which is different from europe and different from the united states : china has huge numbers of people and no space .
red = drums , blue = bass , green = chor@@ ds , orange = leads , purple = pads the mouth@@ piece consists of ...
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s been eight years , and i can tell you that i didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t go to china to become a lawyer .
&@@ #@@ 9@@ 1@@ ; chinese &@@ #@@ 93@@ ; &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; big sister wong , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; wash@@ burn , wong , same difference .
what about art ?
everyone was glued to the tv , watching disturbing , frightening images taken from the edge of the neighborhood .
when we got there , we just went in the street , started talking with people everywhere , and we realized that things were a bit different from the rhetoric we heard in the media .
people come around us and start asking , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; what are you doing here ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
i just observed .
then the next day , i held a meeting on the main square and some women came .
we went to africa , sudan , sierra leone , liberia , kenya .
you know what i love is , for example , when you see the biggest eye there , there are so &@@ #@@ 9@@ 1@@ ; many &@@ #@@ 93@@ ; houses inside .
for each project we do a film .
but yesterday the city called them and said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; look , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to have to tear it down .
actually the fact that art cannot change things makes it a neutral place for exchanges and discussions , and then enables you to change the world .
and we come from a long tradition of sharing .
one of the founders went to switzerland , saw it implemented some@@ place , said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; wow , that looks really cool .
the number across the u.s. and western europe is eight percent .
so here we have ludo@@ truck , which is in l.a. , doing the things that gour@@ met food trucks do , and they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve gathered quite a following .
super fun , and it happens in a very transitional neighborhood .
the future , as we know it , is very unpredictable .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve seen it in the financial crisis . we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve seen it in the pandemic flu .
but will this only be available for the super rich , for those that can afford it ? are we headed for a new eu@@ geni@@ cs ?
an individual , for the first time in the history of humanity , will have the capacity , by 2030 , to destroy the planet , to wreck everything , through the creation , for example , of a biop@@ ath@@ o@@ gen .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m not on top of the class .
but , most importantly , while i was traveling , i taught children carto@@ oning , and in exchange , i learned how to be spontaneous .
i was hesitant to include this in my presentation because this cartoon was published soon after 9 / 11 .
everything had to be larger . the next painting was even bigger .
this is a work , a library i designed for the robin hood foundation .
so then i said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; nets , what do i do ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
we had fashion designers , installation artists , models , we had makeup artists , jewelry designers , all kinds of people working with me to make my wedding an art installation .
my works also turned autobio@@ graphical .
you know i sat at home and i watched .
and i drew it out for her .
e : ach@@ oo !
can you get down ?
because one of her favorite folks from back home is here , and she &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s pretty nervous to meet him .
e : qu@@ ack , qu@@ ack , qu@@ ack .
sw : you are very special . what would you like to say to all these nice people ?
and on one particular day , the cam@@ pers were jumping through inner tubes , they were diving through inner tubes . and i thought this would be great fun .
i started seeking out tri@@ athletes because i found that lifelong swimmers often couldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t teach what they did .
the head is held in line with the spine , so that you use strategic water pressure to raise your legs up -- very important , especially for people with lower body fat .
so i thought why not punish myself ? i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll do japanese .
and that set me on this panic driven search for the perfect language method .
and so i ended up walking like this .
i interviewed these people because they all taught in buenos aires .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s just one benefit of that .
what i want to talk about today is one idea .
now not surprisingly , that influenced some people to think we were onto something .
geoff mul@@ gan : a short in@@ tro to the studio school
and the phili@@ stine who is sent down , their mighty warrior , is a giant .
so david , in that story , is supposed to be the underdog , right ?
if you go back over the history of ancient warfare , you will find time and time again that s@@ lin@@ gers were the decisive factor against infantry in one kind of battle or another .
and then there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s this whole weird thing about how long it takes goli@@ ath to react to the sight of david .
and that would also explain so much of what was strange about his behavior that day .
and something fe@@ stered inside me after this happened .
we have millions of genes of micro@@ bes in our human microbi@@ ome covering us .
and so , these studies have documented or suggested out of a variety of important functions for the microbi@@ al community , this cloud , the non-@@ pathogens that live in and on us .
we should treat it carefully and with respect , and we do not want to mess with it , say by c-@@ sections or by antibiotics or excessive clean@@ liness , without some real good justification .
and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re doing . so wikipedia -- you just saw the little demonstration of it -- it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a freely licensed en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pedia . it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s written by thousands of volunteers all over the world in many , many languages .
and he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s only been our employee since january 2005 , all the other growth before that .
the media has covered this somewhat extensively .
we should merely report on what reput@@ able parties have said about it .
these are the people who are doing the bulk of the site , and they are , in a sense , semi-@@ professionals at what they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re doing , that the standards we set for ourselves are equal to or higher than professional standards of quality .
so somebody says , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; delete it , please . delete it -- it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not notable . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and i also like to say she &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the only person who actually knows all the rules of wikipedia , so ...
ben saunders : yeah , hi , ben saunders .
i and my colleagues art aron and lucy brown and others , have put 37 people who are ma@@ dly in love into a functional mri brain scanner .
almost nobody gets out of love alive .
we found activity in a tiny , little factory near the base of the brain called the vent@@ ral te@@ g@@ mental area .
two thousand years later , we can explain this in the brain .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve also come to believe that romantic love is an addiction : a perfectly wonderful addiction when it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s going well , and a perfectly horrible addiction when it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s going poorly .
our newest experiment has been hat@@ ched by my colleague , art aron -- putting people who are reporting that they are still in love , in a long-term relationship , into the functional mri .
so , i will close with this . these are my older people .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m not quite sure .

and like all the dolphins in our community , we photographed mu@@ gs@@ y and tracked her little spots and ni@@ cks in her dor@@ sal fin , and also the unique spot patterns as she mat@@ ured over time .
and they use these bur@@ st-@@ pul@@ sed sounds as well as their head-to-head behaviors when they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re fighting .
this underwater keyboard in orlando , florida , at the ep@@ cot center , was actually the most sophisticated ever two-@@ way interface designed for humans and dolphins to work together under the water and exchange information .
the di@@ ver here has a rope toy , and i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m on the keyboard on the left , and i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve just played the rope key , and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the request for the toy from the human .
the dolphin &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s at the keyboard .
denise her@@ zing : could we speak the language of dolphins ?
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s based on an argentini@@ an rhythm called &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; carni@@ val@@ ito . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
commentator : there he is .
so the idea was , okay , keep that feeling of freedom , but change the ve@@ ctor and increase the time .
because this is -- i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m quite an experienced manager of systems as a pilot , but this is really -- you need flu@@ i@@ dity , you need to be agile and also to adapt really fast .
so i did try to take , again , a climb altitude .
with that , i have to adapt to something new .
yr : i have a standard answer .
i bet those pre@@ historic cave artists would have loved to know how to draw better .
wor@@ ry@@ ingly , there is no consensus about what it is .
we don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t see those nuclear reactions in stars .
so we perceive nothing as what it really is .
why a marriage contract and not any other reason for regular annual action ?
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the basic regulating principle of the enligh@@ ten@@ ment .
so this little slide here shows you an op@@ tom@@ e@@ tri@@ st and the little blue person represents about 10,000 people and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the ratio in the u.@@ k .
i have a global vision for vision .
i have to say , it wasn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t exactly what i had in mind for my first day down under .
so , the new festival , it asks the audience to play an essential role in shaping the performance .
case in point : when &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; the sultan &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s elephant &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; came to london just nine months after 7 / 7 , a londoner wrote , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; for the first time since the london bombings , my daughter called up with that spar@@ kle back in her voice .
&@@ #@@ 9@@ 1@@ ; &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; academy award winner for visual effects &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; &@@ #@@ 93@@ ; second doctor : welcome to your new body , ja@@ ke@@ .@@ first doctor : good .
and what these images are -- you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll see them at the start of the slide show -- there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s only about four images -- but it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s of a little bear that lives in the great bear rainforest .
after a while of reading this in the news , it just becomes news .
but unfortunately , 95 percent of the glaciers in the arctic are also rece@@ ding right now to the point that the ice is ending up on land and not inje@@ cting any ice back into the ecosystem .
after an hour in these conditions , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s so extreme that , when i go down , almost every dive i vo@@ mit into my regulator because my body can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t deal with the stress of the cold on my head .
when i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m on my death@@ bed , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to remember one story more than any other .
it just sees this big balloon in the ocean -- it doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t have hands -- it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s going to take a little bite , the boat pops , and off they go .
i put my fli@@ ppers on . i could barely part my lips .
this just didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t happen a couple of times .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a story that lives deep in my heart , and i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m proud to share this with you .
now that you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re done looking at those , close them down , because every phone has something in common .
now , instead of doing it like mis@@ direction and throwing it off to the side , instead , what i choose to focus on is frank , to be able to play with the frank inside your head , your little security guard , and get you , instead of focusing on your external senses , just to go internal for a second .
do you have a wallet on you ? joe : i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t .
open your hand . thank you very much .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to try to push it inside your hand .
down here i noticed this . is this something of yours , sir ?
never have been .
we did not imagine that there would be this many maps around the world .
could we leverage these technologies to switch smar@@ tly whenever you travel from country to country ?
and the local financing is not part of the ecosystem for supporting hardware projects .
we need to look for something else , and we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve gotten ourselves a little bit into a rut .
this last project is also of components .
you can actually predict what kinds of books they like to read , what kinds of places they like to travel to , and what kinds of food they like to eat .
and by the matrix , i mean literally the matrix , like the movie &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; the matrix . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
it gives us very strong feelings about those who cause harm .
i think this is what we come with , at least a preparedness to learn all of these things .
notice also that on all of these graph@@ s , the slope is stee@@ per on in-@@ group , authority , pur@@ ity .
so this tri@@ pt@@ ych , these three panels portray the timeless truth that order tends to deca@@ y .
because i think that the greatest wonder in the world is not the grand canyon .
they want order , even at some cost to those at the bottom .
can you be not for or against anything ?
what i want to talk to you about today is some of the problems that the military of the western world -- australia , united states , u.k. and so on -- face in some of the deployments that they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re dealing with in the modern world at this time .
so again , they would say , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; well if we have access to non-@@ lethal weapons , if we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got someone we know is hostile , we can do something to deal with them and know that if we hit anyone else around the place , at least , again , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re not going to kill them . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
they generally seem to think , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; well , why would we care what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s happened with the police ?
so the next two years were the years they studied -- 2001 , 2002 .
it was used indiscrimin@@ ately .
in fact , he was probably six inches taller than me , and she was about this tall .
they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re trained to be more restrained in the use of force than the military are .
and the question he had is , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; can i do it ? can it be done ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
we have art students getting together , taking old radi@@ ator parts and doing an ir@@ on-@@ pour to make something new out of it .
they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re a bit subver@@ sive in what they do .
and then he didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t particularly like school that much , but he got involved in robotics competitions , and he realized he had a talent , and , more importantly , he had a real passion for it .
now that could be a dog door , it could be someone going somewhere where they shouldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t , like a little brother into a little sister &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s room .
this is steve wo@@ z@@ ni@@ ak . where does he learn about computers ?
and drew bar@@ ry@@ more , for all her wonderful charm , is not glamorous either .
and this is he@@ dy la@@ marr .
this is fili@@ pp@@ ino li@@ ppi &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s 15@@ 43 portrait of saint apol@@ lon@@ ia .
so you can do a glamor@@ ized picture of a car , but you can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t do a glamor@@ ized picture of traffic .
the sense of , you know , life could be better , i could join this -- i could be a perfect person , i could join this perfect world .
so , this session &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s supposed to be about pure pleasure but glamour &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s really partly about meaning .
it was criticized for glamor@@ i@@ zing violence , because , look -- sunglasses and those long coats , and , of course , they could walk up walls and do all these kinds of things that are impossible in the real world .
so she &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s even more glamorous if you know that she really wasn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t stupid , even though she thought she could look stupid .
it was a way of locating myself .
oh sure , sure , i had moments of appreciation of my body , the way an abusive parent can sometimes have a moment of kindness .
i heard about a little girl who couldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t stop pe@@ eing on herself because so many grown soldiers had sho@@ ved themselves inside her .
and the fire that burned in me on day three through six of chem@@ o is the fire that is burning in the forests of the world .
it was the honey in the water that made it sweet , it was the oil that made it sick .
it was all these things .
obviously the whole project here is huge .
and ivan puts his sandwich over here , on top of the pir@@ ate chest .
which sandwich is he going to take ?
no , because the wind should get in trouble .
now she thinks the powder is sugar .
okay , so it causes a small involun@@ tary contraction in my hand by putting a magnetic pulse in my brain .
so , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a couple of things to say about t@@ ms .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a great answer . rebecca sax@@ e , thank you very much . that was fantastic .
and sometimes it takes a wake-up call , doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t it , to alert us to the fact that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re hur@@ rying through our lives , instead of actually living them ; that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re living the fast life , instead of the good life .
but i think if you cut through those forces , you get to what might be the deeper driver , the nu@@ b of the question , which is how we think about time itself .
and in this , towns begin to rethink how they organize the urban landscape , so that people are encouraged to slow down and smell the roses and connect with one another .
and norway , sweden , denmark and finland now rank among the top six most competitive nations on earth , and they work the kind of hours that would make the average american wee@@ p with envy .
i think there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a kind of meta@@ physical dimension -- that speed becomes a way of wall@@ ing ourselves off from the bigger , deeper questions .
i no longer hear time &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s win@@ ged chari@@ ot drawing near , or at least not as much as i did before .
how do you discover the uniqu@@ eness of a project as unique as a person ?
and when there were complaints about budget , i said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; well , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s worth doing the island because you get twice for your money : refle@@ ctions . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and i went down and chief minister bad@@ al said to me , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; we si@@ kh@@ s have suffered a great deal , as you have jews .
and again , i felt kind of uncomfortable with the notion that a building the size of the washington building -- 50,000 square feet -- will sit on that fragile hill and that we will go into galleries -- rooms with doors and sort of familiar rooms -- to tell the story of the holocaust .
studies for the structure of the roof , which demands maybe new materials : how to make it white , how to make it trans@@ lu@@ cent , how to make it glowing , how to make it not capri@@ cious .
so i think i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to start with what i just heard .
so i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to show you , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to play just for a second .
well we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re jazz musicians , so stereo@@ typically we don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t have a great relationship to finance .
nam@@ aste . sal@@ aam .
i have come from a place of intense darkness .
actually , i come from britain , but i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve been living in maldives for 26 years now .
it comes off the ocean here and is drawn up towards india .
now , the particular species of dra@@ gon@@ fly i want to talk about is this one , because most dra@@ gon@@ flies , like the one we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve just seen , when the adult is there for its brief one or two months of life , it doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t go very far . it can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t travel very far .
and i didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t think anything more of it until the following year , when it happened again , and then the year after that , and then the year after that .
you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re too keen . you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re too keen . no . hang on . hang on .
it stretches about 500 miles , of course it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s india here .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the inter-@@ monsoon , the time when the monsoon changes .
the lar@@ vae have to develop very quickly .
and the dra@@ gon@@ flies are there . i have reports from my various contacts .
and i only stumbled on this because i was living in mal@@ é , in maldives for long enough for it to per@@ col@@ ate into my brain that something rather special was going on .
and they are not the only one that makes the crossing .
so , that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve done with my life .
champion sounds so go@@ of@@ y , but it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what it was , right ?
and this one , look how it slides side@@ ways , every which way ?
this one , a little sket@@ chy going backwards , and watch the back foot , watch the back foot .
and they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re not all bad .
next . and this is something deeper , and this is where i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m — i think i was on tour when i , i was reading one of the fe@@ yn@@ man bio@@ graphi@@ es . it was the red one or the blue one .
and so many people , i guess , watch those videos .
but carl norden is really the one who cracks the code .
so in the years leading up to the second world war , the u.s. military buys 90,000 of these norden bomb@@ sights at a cost of $ 14,000 each -- again , in 1940 dollars , that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a lot of money .
well how many clou@@ dless skies do you think there were above central europe between 1940 and 1945 ?
and their mission was to find and to destroy -- remember the sc@@ ud missile launchers , those sur@@ face-to-@@ air missiles that the ira@@ q@@ is were launching at the israelis ?
in that exact same period that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve been using these drones with devastating accuracy , the number of attacks , of suicide attacks and terrorist attacks , against american forces in afghanistan has increased ten@@ fold .
and visiting some pretty incredible places , places like mongo@@ lia , cambodia , new guinea , south africa , tanzania twice -- i was here a month ago .
but that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not really the question i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m asking .
but looking around the world at the diversity of humans , he said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; well , you know , we seem to come in discre@@ et sub-@@ species or categories . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and the whole thing , if you add it all together , is over six billion nu@@ cle@@ o@@ tides long .
and what that means is that we originated in africa . it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s written in our dna .
now , africa is the most tropical continent on the planet -- about 85 percent of it lies between cancer and capri@@ corn -- and there aren &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t a lot of glaciers here , except on the high mountains here in east africa .
we became much more social . the social networks expanded .
and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s based on a few thousand people we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve sam@@ pled from , you know , a handful of populations around the world .
projects around the world -- documenting oral poetry in sierra leone , preserving traditional wea@@ ving patterns in gaza , language revitali@@ zation in ta@@ ji@@ kistan , etc . , etc .
well , the answer seems to be , the universe can create complexity , but with great difficulty .
and at first , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s just a blur , but very quickly distinct things begin to appear in that blur .
stars will create the gol@@ di@@ locks conditions for crossing two new thresh@@ olds .
you also need a great diversity of chemical elements , and you need liquid such as water .
as it copies itself , once in every billion r@@ ungs , there tends to be an error .
we are blessed with a language , a system of communication , so powerful and so precise that we can share what we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve learned with such precision that it can accu@@ mulate in the collective memory .
collective learning is a very , very powerful force , and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not clear that we humans are in charge of it .
and then they blame the banks for being the bad guys who gave them the mortgages .
low-income people spend a lot more than a thousand on lotter@@ ies .
take out those who say they save too little .
or as some economists call it , present bias .
what are the implications to saving lives and having organs available ?
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s very painful , even though it doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t mean anything .
maybe we should make people save more when they make more money .
if you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re thinking about people taking too much risk and not understanding how much risk they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re taking or taking too little risk , we need to think about that .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s completely fu@@ cked up and can only be explained in song .
you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re live .
have a great session .
when i go out to direct a film , every day we prepare too much , we think too much .
and i say , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; cate , what do you want to do ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
so , how far does etern@@ ity go ?
we tell ourselves stories .
because she fell in love with walter raleigh , she was giving up the reasons she was a queen , and then walter raleigh fell in love with her lady in waiting , and she had to decide whether she was a queen going to war or she wanted ...
elizabeth : be@@ ss ?
elizabeth : this man has sedu@@ ced a ward of the queen , and she has married without royal consent .
so how do i start all this ?
they suck up all the water , keep to themselves , and they drip feed the lower city .
it is fin@@ ite ; harmony is infinite .
i met a guy -- the guy on the left .
we needed to be working on beef .
this is where we stand today .
we need to use less to make more .
they may have a lot of opinions about it , but they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re not going to be terribly informed .
are we going to work with 1.5 billion producers ?
we need change even working with individual companies is not probably going to get us there .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re using whatever leverage we have to bring them to the table .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s more with less and less again .
i am a neuro@@ scientist with a mixed background in physics and medicine .
and i promise to you , this was such an important moment in my career , when i realized that the great leader believed in young people and new ideas .
let me sum@@ mari@@ ze : the rat received a paraly@@ zing le@@ sion of the spinal cord .
they are the result of a young team of very talented people : physical therapists , neuro@@ bi@@ ologists , neuro@@ surgeons , engineers of all kinds , who have achieved together what would have been impossible by single individuals .
a spinal cord injury can se@@ ver the communication between your brain and your body , leading to paralysis . fresh from his lab , gr@@ é@@ go@@ ire cour@@ tine shows a new method -- combining drugs , electrical stimulation and a robot -- that could re-@@ awa@@ ken the ne@@ ural pathways and help the body learn again to move on its own . see how it works , as a paraly@@ zed rat becomes able to run and navigate stairs .
i am an example of what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s possible when girls from the very beginning of their lives are loved and nur@@ tured by the people around them .
and i think about that today because i am reminded and convinced that all of you in this school are very important parts of closing that gap .
i loved getting as .
because the world is big .
summer@@ time and the living is easy fish are jumping and the cotton is high oh , your daddy &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s rich and your ma is goo@@ d-looking so hus@@ h little baby don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t you cry and i opened my eyes , and i saw that she had her eyes closed .
&@@ quo@@ t@@ ; the human voice : mysterious , spontaneous , pri@@ mal . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; with these words , sopran@@ o clar@@ on mc@@ fad@@ den invites us to explore the mysteries of breathing and singing , as she performs the challenging &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; aria , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; by john cage . &@@ amp@@ ; lt ; em &@@ amp@@ ; gt ; &@@ amp@@ ; lt ; / em &@@ amp@@ ; gt ;
no ceo , no firm responsible , singly , for building it .
instead , again , it is as if we are all sitting together in a theater , but we can only see amidst the fog the people immediately around us .
how did this happen ?
i am not making this up .
and wikipedia has embraced this .
but then , you can see the same kind of wh@@ im@@ sy applied to people .
here is the chart of over 43 people helping to steer the robot that could not steer and get it on its way , from one corner from one corner of washington square park to another .
radical openness is still a distant future in the field of school education .
in red , sort of below oecd average .
spending per student only explains about , well , less than 20 percent of the performance variation among countries , and luxembourg , for example , the most expensive system , doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t do particularly well .
germany , my own country , in the year 2000 , featured in the lower quad@@ rant , below average performance , large social disparities .
it didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t change its economy . it didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t change the com@@ positions of its population .
high performers on p@@ isa embrace diversity with differenti@@ ated pe@@ dago@@ gical practices .
every school succeeds .
rich countries have been sending aid to poor countries for the last 60 years .
there could be all sorts of technologies . and one is cell phones .
so i started looking for any evidence that -- does connectivity really increase productivity ?
and one of them is the lacking buying power .
and anyway , to cut the time short -- so i started -- i first went to them and said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; you know , perhaps i could connect all your branches and make you more efficient . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
now , about that cow model i talked about .
&@@ quo@@ t@@ ; poor countries need aid . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
in sweden we read it once and then we went partying .
18@@ 58 in china was the victory in the op@@ ium war by the british forces .
but really , really natural sovereignty was good for japan .
this is the great leap forward , when china fell down .
you see this enormous inequ@@ ity in china , in the midst of fast economic growth .
i will show income per person on this axis instead , poor down here , rich up there .
but the real projections for those ones , i would like to give it like this .
for most of my research career , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve been using acceler@@ ators , such as the elec@@ tron acceler@@ ator at stanford university , just up the road , to study things on the smallest scale .
in fact , this galaxy and every other galaxy appears to be embedded in a cloud of this invisible dark matter .
now , how do we dedu@@ ce where the galaxy is ?
we call this gravit@@ ational len@@ sing .
and also , you can tell by eye , by looking at this , that these ar@@ cs are not centered on individual galaxies .
the startling answer to this question , ok , from these experiments , was that space is expanding at a faster rate today than it was a few billion years ago , ok .
one or both , who knows ? or it could be something completely different .
we discovered blue@@ grass a few years ago , and we fell in love with it . we hope you guys will too .
and what was so sad about this particular story was that once their parents had found out -- and don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t forget , their parents took them to the doctor -- the parents threw them out on the street .
they squ@@ ir@@ t them at each other , which is lovely and innocent .
if you know something more , you probably know that uganda , to date , is the only country in sub-saharan africa that has had success in combating the epidemic .
we didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t see anything like that in africa .
so one way to test to see whether we can explain some of this behavior change by differences in life expectancy is to look and see is there more behavior change in areas where there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s less malaria .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not the only place we had any interventions .
but since there are very few other diseases that kill people , we can really attribute that mortality to hiv .
and hiv is actually particularly closely linked to transit .
their exports went down a lot in the early 1990s -- and actually that decline lines up really , really closely with this decline in new hiv infections .
if i could reveal anything that is hidden from us , at least in modern cultures , it would be to reveal something that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve forgotten , that we used to know as well as we knew our own names .
and he came up to me and he knocked .
so the engineer &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s boss said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; find a way to quiet this train . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and those bumps act like a magnet for water .
and then we wonder why the membran@@ e clo@@ gs and why it takes so much electricity .
embed@@ ding nan@@ op@@ articles in a material for instance , always .
at bi@@ omi@@ mi@@ cry guild , which is my consulting company , we work with ho@@ k architects .
and hopefully , with their help , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll learn how to live on this earth , and on this home that is ours , but not ours alone .
i go , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; why ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
they belonged to boys .
if they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re bad , they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re your creation . learn from it .
what you see , if you see the title called &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; pm &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s car held . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
i said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; do you pray ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
i want to show you some moments of history in my journey , which probably you would never ever get to see anywhere in the world .
and you see , everybody &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s busy . there was no time to waste .
text : &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; help ! i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve been waiting for over 20 minutes , and nothing happens . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
so let me explain how this works .
and basically , since we released it about three or four years ago , a lot of websites have started switching from the old cap@@ t@@ cha where people wasted their time to the new cap@@ t@@ cha where people are helping to dig@@ iti@@ ze books .
imagine you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re using the internet and you see a cap@@ t@@ cha that you think is somewhat peculiar , like this cap@@ t@@ cha .
okay , that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s severin hacker .
so i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll just let you read .
so i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t even know if there exists 100 million people out there using the web who are bilin@@ gual enough to help us translate .
people really can learn a language with it .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the current business model .
instead of investing in a car , we invest in a community .
this peers , inc. concept is in a very difficult and complex realm .
so this was a trick to get these two sides .
and i can tell you two great stories .
we live longer . we have access to technology that would have seemed like science fiction just a few years ago .
maybe these people are right . maybe mind-@@ wandering is a bad thing .
a few minutes ago , i likened mind-@@ wandering to a slot machine you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d never want to play .
and shortly after , we left the country , and we returned to switzerland .
i mean , today , singapore is a first world country and ghana is not .
so when the echo of the gunshots had lin@@ gered , it was soon drowned by the chanting of the mob , and i didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t believe what i was hearing .
now i have learned that my place is not just in the west or in africa , and i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m still searching for my identity , but i saw ghana create democracy better .
so i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to talk a little bit about that , and what exactly is it that scientists are supposed to do .
so therefore the church said that you can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t make a vacuum , you know .
the actual nature of reality was not at issue .
and , i mean , everybody in this room -- now , this is 350 short years ago .
i was thinking about making my own little rockets .
it burned kind of slow , but it made a nice smell , compared to other rocket fuels i had tried , that all had sul@@ fur in them .
but that ... process is what i think of as science , see , where you start with some idea , and then instead of , like , looking up , every authority that you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve ever heard of i -- sometimes you do that , if you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to write a paper later , you want to figure out who else has worked on it .
they made all kinds of -- and then finally one giant bomb to end the whole thing , right ?
but nobody actually demonstrated it , right ?
you know , if they said , you know what ?
and in grad school i became interested in creatures that dwell in the hidden corners of the city .
when i got comfortable in the space , it also felt like a big playground .
it must have been a very unusual day for him .
they were consistently dug as lime@@ stone quar@@ ries and by the 18th century , the cav@@ ing-@@ in of some of these quar@@ ries posed safety threats , so the government ordered rein@@ forcing of the existing quar@@ ries and dug new observation tunnels in order to monitor and map the whole place .
and this is the first theater project i worked on .
and if you can , just scri@@ bble a pattern .
and when we gave them a battery , and a piece of wire , and a bulb , and said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; can you do it ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; they couldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t do it . right ?
between australia and here , right , they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got summer and we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got winter , and what -- does the earth kind of rush towards the sun at night , and then rush back again ? i mean , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a very strange thing going on , and we hold these two models in our head , of what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s right and what isn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t right , and we do that , as human beings , in all sorts of fields .
so , children are not empty vessels , ok ?
now -- oh , oh yeah , go on then , go on .
so when i thought about it , then suddenly i realized that biology gave us the answer .
so as a chemi@@ st , i wanted to say , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; hang on . what is going on here ?
you have regulation ; information is tran@@ scribed ; cataly@@ sts are made ; stuff is happening .
so there are two options : intelligent design , direct and indirect -- so god , or my friend .
i need some information , and i need a container .
if we manage to do that , forget the molecular detail .
you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re sitting on chairs .
because the thing is , we are so chau@@ vini@@ stic to biology , if you take away carbon , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s other things that can happen .
and i will take kenya as an example .
have got these surveys in place in their database , then they use advanced mathemati@@ cal formulas to produce a trend line , and the trend line looks like this .
so what i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m telling you is that we know the child mortality .
here we have &@@ #@@ 9@@ 1@@ ; the &@@ #@@ 93@@ ; year .
my ancestors moved to the united states .
here we have a problem .
and look now , the first african countries here are coming in .
that is , when we get girls in school , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll get an impact 15 to 20 years later , which is a secular trend which is very strong .
and if they do so , then , of course , the conditions improve , and they start riding on scoo@@ ters .
of course , as soon as you say something like this people say it is impossible , and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what was said by suzuki .
broke many norms of the standard conventions for the first time .
and nan@@ o was , bang , 2,000 dollars .
you have to design an artificial foot for such conditions .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve talked about mobility and the rest of it , let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s talk about health .
you know something ? this has been achieved in india .
sorry , it doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t work . you have to give it for 100 dollars , 200 dollars .
ladies and gentlemen , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d like to end before time .
when the paper burned , for some reason he turned to me , and he said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; mas@@ hel@@ kar , like this , if you do not diffu@@ se your energies , if you focus your energies , you can achieve anything in the world . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d like to share a couple with you today .
so we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re getting feedback from teachers at the school to see what kind of apps they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d like .
and i realized that i had hit upon something that i think has this huge potential to change the world .
and the reason the effici@@ encies are so low is these reactors operate at pretty low temperature .
the fuel , like i said , is ceramic inside zir@@ con@@ ium fuel ro@@ ds , and in the event of an accident in one of these type of reactors , fukushima and three mile island -- looking back at three mile island , we didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t really see this for a while — but these zir@@ con@@ ium cla@@ d@@ dings on these fuel ro@@ ds , what happens is , when they see high pressure water , steam , in an oxi@@ di@@ zing environment , they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll actually produce hydrogen , and that hydrogen has this explosive capability to release fi@@ ssion products .
everybody was really excited about curiosity , and that had this big pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um battery on board that has pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um-@@ 238 , which actually has a higher specific activity than the low-@@ enriched uranium fuel of these mol@@ ten salt reactors , which means that the effects would be neg@@ ligible , because you launch it cold , and when it gets into space is where you actually activate this reactor .
so , we moved from an industrial economy to a service-@@ based economy .
so much has that happened that i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve developed a fairly pr@@ ati@@ ced response , which is : i point out that first of all , you have to understand that there is no such thing as an in@@ authentic experience .
rendering authenticity -- and the key@@ word is &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; rendering . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
fact is , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a general rule : if you don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t like it , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s fake ; if you do like it , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s faux .
the abc network , affection@@ ately known in the trade as the t &@@ amp@@ ; amp ; a network , right -- that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not too much jargon , is it ?
let me sum@@ mari@@ ze it , for the business people in the audience , with three rules , three basic rules .
i was also very interested in perhaps going into surgery and becoming a surgeon , because it meant working with my hands in a very focused , intense way .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s about that big .
so , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s sort of related , but you can see it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s much more over@@ tly ero@@ tic .
but i had a lot of fun .
and your entire body , everything -- your hair , skin , bone , nails -- everything is made of collagen .
the marvel of this information : how do we actually have this biological mechanism inside our body to actually see this information ?

because they thought that if you are having a telescope , you are an astron@@ omer so what you are doing is actually looking in a telescope .

it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s very tough . it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s very tough .
there can be different ways doing this .
and i thought , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; well , what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the struggle ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m more of the , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; life &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s messy , clean it up , organize it and put it into a ben@@ to box . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
the things i can tell you about it : it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s universal ; we all have it .
so what i did is i took all of the interviews where i saw wor@@ thin@@ ess , where i saw people living that way , and just looked at those .
they thought this was fundamental .
and she said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the struggle ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
no .
and then we are miserable , and we are looking for purpose and meaning , and then we feel vulnerable , so then we have a couple of beers and a banana nut mu@@ ffin .

years after he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s had these drugs , i learned that everything he did to manage his excess sali@@ va , including some positive side effects that came from other drugs , were making his con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation worse .
so , this is what happened when pn@@ as published this .
and then we say , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; well how do we line them all up ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
even the ones that believed they were getting better matched the controls exactly . exactly .
you look at the patients , you can drill in all the controls , you can look at them , you can ask them .
only 90 days after this , arguably the greatest discovery of the last century occurred .

we said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; could you build this ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s just wrong .
unfortunately , the answer is yes .
so if it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a cell or a ter@@ mit@@ e or a bird , you just focus on the rules of interaction .
i think this is an interesting question .
so this means that , with each euro he invested , he was able to move 26 euros of market value through the chain of ownership relations .
we hope to have opened the door for more such research in this direction , so the remaining unknown terrain will be charted in the future .
if we look at construction and manufacturing , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s major in@@ effici@@ encies , energy consumption and excessive labor techniques .
so we can study this as a physical , intuitive model .

we will find a surprising and intriguing result about our universe , and to explain my point , let me first tell you what the hi@@ ggs is about , and to do so , we have to go back to one tenth of a billion@@ th of a second after the big bang .
is this a problem ? yes , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a big a problem .
more than how a phenomenon works , theoretical physi@@ cists are always interested in why a phenomenon works in the way it works .
i love paper , and i love technology , and what i do is i make paper interactive .
so the challenge was to try and get them to do what we wanted them to do by listening to the weather , the lay of the land , and creating things that would let the sheep flow and go where we wanted them to go .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s just a collection of things that have been done before , but bringing them together in a different way .

you can walk away , you can just watch as this character stands there in the blender and looks at you , or you can actually choose to interact with it .

fortunately , necessity remains the mother of invention , and a lot of the design work that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re the most proud of with the aircraft came out of solving the unique problems of operating it on the ground -- everything from a continu@@ ous@@ ly-@@ variable transmission and liqui@@ d-@@ based cooling system that allows us to use an aircraft engine in stop@@ -and-@@ go traffic , to a custom@@ -@@ designed ge@@ ar@@ box that powers either the prop@@ eller when you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re flying or the wheels on the ground , to the automated wing-@@ folding mechanism that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll see in a moment , to crash safety features .
and our test pilot gave us the best feedback you can get from a test pilot after a first flight , which was that it was &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; remarkably un@@ remarkable . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
just fold up the wings and keep going .
now , here is another naive advertising man &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s question again .
so he tried plan b .
tiny little behavioral economics detail : in italy , penalty points go backwards .
there is a basic view that real value involves making things , involves labor . it involves engineering .
it tastes great within the borders of that country , but absolute sh@@ ite if you take it anywhere else .

it took me hours and hours a day to build my skills up to the next level .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re the ones who let the second repli@@ cator out of its box , and we can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t push it back in .
you see the idea ?
he talked mostly about animals and plants , but also about languages evolving and becoming extinct .
a meme is not equivalent to an idea .

from the moment that our ancestors , perhaps two and a half million years ago or so , began imit@@ ating , there was a new cop@@ ying process .

do you know , sitting here , your brain is using about 20 percent of your body &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s energy output for two percent of your body weight ?
and why would they do that ?
it was 25 minutes of absolute terror that thousands of people across the u.s. felt .
there is nothing here that we don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t know .
through haiti re@@ wired , through build change , architecture for humanity , ai@@ dg , there is the possibility to reach out to 30,000 -- 40,000 mas@@ ons across the country and create a movement of proper building .
this is not just in he@@ brew , by the way .
and i want to give you one example of one of these irr@@ ation@@ alities , and i want to talk to you about cheating .
we paid them 10 cents per correct question , 50 cents , a dollar , five dollars , 10 dollars per correct question .
now , ten comman@@ d@@ ments is something that is hard to bring into the education system , so we said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; why don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t we get people to sign the honor code ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
but this did not solve the big problem i had with en@@ ron yet , because in en@@ ron , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s also a social element .
all of the subjects sitting in the experiment were carnegie mell@@ on students .
more generally , i want to tell you something about behavioral economics .
but if i was to say that they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re both examples of alternative or new forms of currency in a hyper@@ connected , data-@@ driven global economy , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d probably think i was a little bit bon@@ kers .
&@@ quo@@ t@@ ; sub-@@ prime ped@@ aling . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; barclays takes you for a ride . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
so you can buy apps and make purchases within those apps , but you think about amazon , you look at the trust barometer that i showed you where people are starting to trust businesses , especially businesses that they believe in and trust more than governments .
and we did a survey that backs up the fact that , you know , 45 percent of people in this very crucial demographic in the u.s .
and what i do is i look for similarities and differences in the solutions that they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve evolved for fundamental biological problems .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s easy to bend .
because after about six months of me talking about this , i think he finally figured out that i was really serious about the penis thing .
so something interesting had to be going on .
not just about its genetics and molecular biology , but up here in the meat end of the scale .
and she said , just talk about yourself .
dl : so anyway , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re running out of time , so i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll just get to it .

so this is our last number , and we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll feature nat on piano .
as you can see from the pictures , both no@@ am and i had an early fascination with first principles , and over the years , as our knowledge of science and technology became more sophisticated , this early awe with the basics has only intensified .
the people who are attracted to these courses typically have a hacker mentality .
so with that , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d like to say a few words about upgrading , and share with you a glimpse from my current project , which is different from the previous one , but it shares exactly the same characteristics of self-@@ learning , learning by doing , self-@@ exploration and community-@@ building , and this project deals with k-@@ 12 math education , beginning with early age math , and we do it on tablets because we believe that math , like anything else , should be taught hands on .
it basically means to be human and to do the right thing .
it would be great if the story ended there .
where does it come from ?
this is about a hidden corner of the labor market .
of course , they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re all trained to work in warehouses .
markets have changed beyond recognition in the last 20 years , but only for organizations at the top of the economy .
politicians in a big , complex , sophisticated i.@@ t. project ?
and there are certain obligations that should go with those benefits to be placed on the operators , and the key one is , of course , that the operators pay for everything , including all the inter@@ facing into the public sector .
so it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s small trades by small people , but it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s very informed , safe , convenient , low-@@ overhead and immediate .
with every picture , there are individuals who have full lives and stories that deserve to be told .
gas , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m probably the only person who really enjoys it when mi@@ ster putin turns off the gas tap , because my budget goes up .
but small atom@@ s want to join together , small nu@@ cle@@ i want to join together to make bigger ones to go towards iron .
but fortunately , if you can do this fusion reaction , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got a neut@@ ron , so you can make that happen .
and just down the road , this is jet .
i wish we had more money , i wish we had more resources .
but under the surface was a very different reality .
the signs don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t look good , some have said .
the egyptian people , and many other ar@@ abs who &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve revol@@ ted and are in transition , have very high expectations of the government .
what this means is that human development , not se@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation , is what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s key to women &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s empowerment in the transforming middle east .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve also found an unintended consequence .
because i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m not really comfortable just helping that girl with counseling and referrals .
when nancy lu@@ blin started texting teenagers to help with her social advocacy organization , what she found was shocking -- they started texting back about their own problems , from bullying to depression to abuse . so she &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s setting up a tex@@ t-@@ only crisis line , and the results might be even more important than she expected .
ferdinand fo@@ ch , a french army general credited with having one of the most original and subtle minds in the french army , said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; airplanes are interesting toys , but of no military value . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s pointed at the hypersonic gli@@ der .
many proto@@ types crashed -- many .
from the smallest wis@@ p of air to the powerful forces of nature &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s storms .
it allows us to contribute and to be heard as individuals .

yeah , it also went into the pacific .
the folks at aero@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment tried 300 or more different wing designs , 12 different forms of the avi@@ oni@@ cs .
i work with some of the most amazing people .
and there is no way , and no proof of arrival .
this story began four years ago .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m used to algorithms and data structures and super motivated students , and nothing in my background prepared me to deal with a raging , violent adolescent in the middle of nowhere .
when he was eight , someone put him on a boat in odessa and sent him , shipped him to israel on his own .
i tell kids when they struggle through some uphill and feel like they cannot take it anymore , it really helps to ignore the immediate obstacles and raise your head and look around and see how the vista around you grows .
now i remember , when he said it , i felt goo@@ se@@ bumps on my body , because he said it overlooking the mo@@ ab mountains here in the background .
what is real is separ@@ at@@ eness , and at some point in early baby@@ hood , the idea of self starts to form .
it has an extremely important function .
well , i thought i had the answer to that one , and i said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; skin color . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
the self &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s struggle for authenticity and definition will never end unless it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s connected to its creator -- to you and to me .
and if you can do that , incredible things happen .
and this influenced me .
so it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s got hybrid drive .
and so we spent time traveling with them and learning about all the different elements , and finding that there were plenty of in@@ effici@@ encies that weren &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t being capitali@@ zed on .
so there are up to a million people there everyday .
by the way , we had half the budget of the other western nations .
the british government -- any government is potentially the worst client in the world you could ever possibly want to have .
thank you .
one of them , from anthrop@@ ology , is the study of human univers@@ als .
but if something is written on the slate , then some people could have more of it than others , and according to this line of thinking , that would justify discrimination and inequality .
well , pretty soon they were barra@@ ged with enraged letters , death threats , ban on the topic in a number of scientific journ@@ als , coming from ir@@ ate left-@@ han@@ ders and their advocates , and they were literally afraid to open their mail because of the ven@@ om and v@@ itu@@ per@@ ation that they had inadvertently inspired .
by any economic standard , the demand for art of all forms is skyrocketing , as you can tell from the price of opera tickets , by the number of books sold , by the number of books published , the number of musical titles released , the number of new albums and so on .
well , the argument in &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; the blank slate &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; was that elite art and criticism in the 20th century , although not the arts in general , have dis@@ da@@ ined beauty , pleasure , clarity , insight and style .
wrong . identical twins , or any siblings , who are separated at birth are no less similar than if they had grown up together .
so i called the humane society and i say , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; look , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to be ca@@ str@@ ating some lam@@ bs , can you tell me the deal ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m like that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not rubber at all , you know .
and i said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; yes , like the humane society .
albert instru@@ cts , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; push it way up there . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what our network does ; it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; dirty jobs &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; is .
i can still see hillary doing the shots of ry@@ e , dribb@@ ling down her chin , with the steel workers .
you ask him , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; did you follow your passion here ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
un@@ speak@@ ably dangerous .
you see him all the time .
i got a lot wrong .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got par@@ ent-@@ child relation@@ al problems , which i blame my parents for .
but he fa@@ ked it too well , and now he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s stuck in broad@@ moor and nobody will believe he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s sane .
fake madness .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s just impossible . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and his clini@@ cian said to me , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; if you want to know more about psych@@ opa@@ ths , you can go on a psych@@ op@@ ath spotting course run by robert hare who invented the psych@@ op@@ ath check@@ list . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
can i come and interview you about your special brain anom@@ aly ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and he looked intrigued despite himself , and he said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; okay , go on . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and we stit@@ ch them together like medieval mon@@ ks .
anyway , that was two years ago , and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s where my book ended .
let me say par@@ en@@ the@@ tically why i think that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the case , because i think it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a potentially controversial statement .
you can show a mosque , or you can show worshi@@ ppers , but there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not a straightforward way of depicting islam .
and the hopeful response deri@@ ves from recognizing that islam and democracy are technologies .
because they would have done extraordinarily well .
and it is crucial -- it is crucial in a practical , activist way -- for people who care about these issues to make sure that within the technology of democracy , in this system , they exercise their preferences , their choices and their voices to encourage that outcome .
now at the time , i was working down the street .
and collectively , we really didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t know if we could pull this off .
but an interesting thing was noted during the training process .
and they could be extinct in less than 10 years , if we don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t do something now to protect them .
corner row railway , station car park , front of a health center , people &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s front gardens , and even in front of the police station .
so , back to the public meeting .
so we got some land that was donated by a local garden center .
whichever way they want to do it , of their own vo@@ li@@ tion , they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re trying to make their own lives differently , and worldwide , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got communities across america and japan -- it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s incredible , isn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t it ? i mean , america and japan and new zealand .
and i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m also rather surprised , because when i look back on my life the last thing i ever wanted to do was write , or be in any way involved in religion .
so if religion is not about believing things , what is it about ?
and this struggle to find compassion in some of these rather re@@ bar@@ b@@ ative texts is a good dress rehearsal for doing the same in ordinary life .
tell us where we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going wrong . let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s talk together about where religion is failing . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what is meant by overcoming the horror that we feel when we are under threat of our enemies , and beginning to appreciate the other .
as we go smaller , here is a human hair .
so this little ant that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s craw@@ ling here , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s like it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s in a little willy won@@ ka land .
i couldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t believe it , and i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d go around dis@@ sec@@ ting the little bits out and making photographs of them .
now , the moon has no atmosphere , so micro@@ meteor@@ ites come in continuously , and the whole surface of the moon is covered with powder now , because for four billion years it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s been bombarded by micro@@ meteor@@ ites , and when micro@@ meteor@@ ites come in at about 20 to 60,000 miles an hour , they vap@@ ori@@ ze on contact .
it was just one of those po@@ t-@@ luck things where you get it right first time .
the design comes from within .
technology in x-ray where it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s life-@@ size processed , apart from these large car@@ go-@@ scanning machines , hasn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t moved on enough for the quality of the image and the resolution to be good enough for what i want to do with it , which is show my pictures big .
and when they do , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m in the queue .
and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s how this was done . it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s actually slice , slice .
but i could get a bit darker in the tube , but everything else would suffer .
and i think that would look quite neat as an x-ray .
but i also don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t understand how it does ruin the magic .
but every single thing that makes us , every atom in us , has already created a myriad of different things and will go on to create a myriad of new things .
now i know you don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t think that .
every time i breathe in , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m breathing in a million-@@ billion-@@ billion atom@@ s of oxygen .
meet tony . he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s my student .
maybe it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s you , maybe it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s me -- but we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re not here to trade opinions ; everyone &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s got an opinion .
and i say to tony , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s do this . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
everything was okay , until i got to about the age of 26 , and i went to a movie called &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; short circuit . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and this is happening here .
so you start really understanding that you can have diseases , tox@@ ins , a need to balance your diet , and once you start looking , and from that point on , everything i have done in terms of the consumption of information , the production of information , the preparation of information , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve looked at from the view@@ point of food .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve spent a great deal of time investigating a $ 1 billion -- that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s right , a $ 1 billion — oil deal that he was involved with , and what we found was pretty shocking , but more about that later .
a bank in paris held accounts of companies controlled by him , one of which was used to buy the art , and american banks , well , they fun@@ nel@@ ed 73 million dollars into the states , some of which was used to buy that california mansion .
it found that over 70 percent of those cases had used anonymous shell companies , totaling almost 56 billion dollars .
now , it just shouldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t take these sorts of efforts to find out where the money in deals like this went .
i see this word , hear this word , feel this word everywhere .
you become your nation . you become your religion .
i loved when he was talking about this other world that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s right next to this world .
she &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a high school student .
not running from loss , but entering grief , surren@@ dering to sorrow .
because when you spend a lot of time going from place to place , country to country , and city to city , the degree to which women , for example , are violated , and the epidemic of it , and the kind of ordin@@ ar@@ iness of it , is so devastating to one &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s soul that you have to take the time , or i have to take the time now , to process that .
now i was stupid , but not so stupid that i turned it down .
pure content and pure form , side by side .
i was so wasted . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
i set up the type , i printed it out on an ep@@ son prin@@ ter with water-@@ solu@@ ble ink , taped it to the wall and threw a bucket of water at it . pre@@ sto !
seriously .
not exactly jackie collins .
like my wish that no one went hungry or that everything were a free kind of utop@@ ia .
we love challenges , but when expectations are low , trust me , we will sink to them .
and in case you don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t think that this really has meaning for you , remember that c@@ lon@@ ing is possible , and that involves going through childhood again , in which case you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll want to be heard just like my generation .
when i began recording in the late &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; 60s , the typical methods of recording were limited to the fragmented capture of individual species like birds mostly , in the beginning , but later animals like mammals and amphi@@ bi@@ ans .
however , our ears tell us a very different story .
this is probably the sad@@ dest sound i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve ever heard coming from any organis@@ m , human or other .
the school teachers weren &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t having much fun , the sports were very dirty or very painful .
but of course the scientists couldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t help themselves .
so there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a lot more female gamers than people are really aware .
so as far as popularity of games , what do you think these people are doing here ?
and once we get enough of those guys , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to want more fantasy artists that can create places we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve never been to before , or characters that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve just never seen before .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m addicted , because even though i know i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m losing my grip on reality , i still cra@@ ve more .
no buttons to push , no triggers to pull , just me and the game .
but maybe brain@@ washing isn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t always bad .
as far as colleges go , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s about 350 colleges around the world teaching video game courses .
thank you .
somehow we have to understand ourselves to get around our flaws .
so a kid who &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s 14 in high school gets this version of the py@@ th@@ ag@@ ore@@ an theor@@ em , which is a truly subtle and interesting proof , but in fact it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not a good way to start learning about mathematics .
and the mathemati@@ cians and scientists in the crowd will recognize these two progressi@@ ons as a first-@@ order discre@@ te differ@@ ential equation and a second-@@ order discre@@ te differ@@ ential equation , derived by six-@@ year-olds .
so if you look at the little script here , the speed is always going to be 30 .
and they say , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; oh , yeah . constant acceleration .
the future of life , where the unra@@ vel@@ ing of our biology -- and bring up the lights a little bit . i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t have any slides .
now i know there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s been a whole lot of hype about our power to control biology .
it will really make us question what it is to be a human being .
and it is really not suited for the future that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re moving into .
there are three obvious ways of doing this .
humanity is going to go down this path .
the one thing though that is really dangerous about these sorts of technologies , is that it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s easy to become sedu@@ ced by them .
and then what comes out of it ? new life .
gregory stock : to upgrade is human
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s our own pond . and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s how it happens . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
mom , does the man just say , &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; is now the time to take off my pants ? &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; and i said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; yes . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and then she goes , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; mom , do you think they would have , on the internet , any humans mat@@ ing ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
so the possibility exists to simply ex@@ tern@@ ally wrap the pipe .
once you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve made it , the installation &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s quite easy .
and as you can see , there are not only two principal technical discip@@ lines there , medicine and engineering , but also there are various specialists from within those two discip@@ lines .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m sure it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the same in poland .
they simply want to do whatever they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve done before .
and as a result , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s an entirely different use of the technology and the knowledge around you .
that makes a good cartoon .
it has rocked the music industry ; it has changed the way we consume music .
you know the story .
and i went to see the do@@ zo .
and i didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t ask them to do nice carto@@ ons .
thank you .
if you go back two billion years , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re not on an ear@@ th-@@ like planet any more .
we are right now in the beautiful ore@@ o of existence -- of at least life on planet earth -- following the first horrible microbi@@ al age .
and the black rock is the sedi@@ ment on the sea bottom in the absence of plan@@ k@@ ton .
these are mam@@ mal@@ -like rep@@ tiles .
the survivors that do get through produce this world of crocodi@@ le-@@ like creatures .
it can only occur if the surface of the ocean has no oxygen , and is totally saturated with hydrogen sul@@ fide -- enough , for instance , to come out of solution .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s been on this planet since the animals first started -- 500 million years .
now , the same mouse is given 80 parts per million hydrogen sul@@ fide in this solid graph , and look what happens to its temperature .
am i understanding you right , that what you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re saying here is that we have in our own bodies a bio@@ chemical response to hydrogen sul@@ fide that in your mind proves that there have been past mass extin@@ ctions due to climate change ?
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s forced child labor and all of those products probably end their lives in a dump like this one in manila .
and their factory in china -- which probably is pretty clean -- is getting all of the ingredients from backyard ab@@ at@@ to@@ irs , where families slaughter pigs and extract the ingredient .
their voters are local .
even if they did their jobs , and they cited those facilities for their violations , the fine would be der@@ is@@ ory .
you can call yourself responsible , but responsibility without accountability often doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t work .
there are thousands of suppliers in there . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
join us , come into that safe space , and let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s start to make this happen .
you will put the star in starting over , and over .
so i write poems to figure things out .
now i can divide my spoken word journey into three steps .
and then someone else has something the complete opposite of yours .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not that i think that spoken word poetry is the ideal art form .
and i always thought that my beginning was at the bo@@ wery poetry club , but it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s possible that it was much earlier .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what i strive for every time i open my mouth -- that impossible connection .
i was a student in the &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; 60s , a time of social upheaval and questioning , and on a personal level , an awa@@ kening sense of ide@@ alism .
but i was driven by an inherent sense that a picture that revealed the true face of war would almost by definition be an anti-war photograph .
one of the things i had to learn as a journalist was what to do with my anger .
this man had just been liberated from a hut@@ u death camp .
i spent a good deal of time with a man who lived with his family on a railway em@@ bank@@ ment and had lost an arm and a leg in a train accident .
an ms@@ f hospital in a camp for displaced people .
this is a helicopter medic giving cpr to a soldier who had been shot in the head .
whenever there is an election , it seems like something always goes wrong , someone tries to cheat , or something goes accidentally aw@@ ry -- a ballot box goes missing here , ch@@ ads are left hanging over here .
and there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s some complicated crypto@@ graphy going on in there , but what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not complicated is voting with one of these forms .
david bis@@ mark demos a new system for voting that contains a simple , veri@@ fiable way to prevent fraud and mis@@ counting -- while keeping each person &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s vote secret .
but that sub@@ divides christianity , islam and buddh@@ ism into many sub@@ groups , which was too detailed .
but there was also many christian countries that had six to seven babies per woman .
but there are also countries here like guatemala , like pap@@ ua new guinea , like yemen and afghanistan .
here we have qatar today , and there we have bangladesh today .
and the world population will stop growing .
and then again the old will die and you will get two billion children .
i wound up on every television show .
we declared smallpox eradi@@ cated in 1980 .
but in that year , smallpox exploded throughout india .
we failed three other times .
this year , that one hospital will give back sight to more than 300,000 people in tamil nadu , india .
within three weeks it will be everywhere in the world .
but in all seriousness -- because this idea is birth@@ ed in ted , i would like it to be a legacy of ted , and i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d like to call it the &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; international system for total early disease detection . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
but they were able to point to who and let them know that there was this surprising and unexplained cluster of illnesses that looked like bird flu .
the first number is three : three billion people .
we know from asking people from china to the u.s .
you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll change your smartphone seven or eight times , probably more if you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re in this audience .
actually , we found 100 percent is easier to do than 90 percent or 50 percent .
the electricity is free .
and we do not want to wait another hundred years .
there was this equation in my family that went something like this : if you are intelligent , you therefore are not spiritual .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve always been attracted to those rare people who pull that off , who de@@ vote their lives to humanity with the grit of the warrior and the grace of the my@@ stic -- people like martin luther king , jr . , who wrote , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; i can never be what i ought to be until you are what you ought to be .
or maybe your brother@@ -in-law who doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t believe in global warming .
we agreed we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d speak up in our own communities when we witnessed the kind of &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; oth@@ eri@@ zing &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; talk that can wound and fester into par@@ ano@@ ia and then be used by those on the frin@@ ges to inc@@ ite .
i traveled to iraq , afghanistan and liberia .
and he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s on a mission .
and that they were definitely capable of diffu@@ sing it non-@@ aggressively .
but the question that lin@@ gered in my mind was , what causes people to destroy fire trucks headed to their own homes ?
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s been reported that wiki@@ leaks , your baby , has , in the last few years has released more classified documents than the rest of the world &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s media combined .
and then the government sat on it and used it for political leverage on mo@@ i , who was the richest man -- still is the richest man -- in kenya .
roger . i got &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; em .
j well , because these sort of things reveal what the true state of , say , arab governments are like , the true human-@@ rights abuses in those governments .
it will change the perception and opinion of the people who are paying for it all , and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s our hope .
and the engineering report had nothing on the top of it , so it was an extremely difficult document for us .
can that be right ?
that made you very high-profile in iceland . what happened next ?
the musicians played off a three-@@ dimensional graph of weather data like this .
the vertical elements are assigned a specific hour of the day .
lauren ho@@ dge : if you were going to a restaurant and wanted a healthier option , which would you choose , grilled or fried chicken ?
so it was a big commitment to drive to the lab to work multiple times .
sounds ridiculous , right .
in fact , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s one of the biggest problems with chemotherapy today .
1.6 million deaths worldwide .
so julie &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s going to her doctor &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s office to get treated for her asthma .
so i want you to reimag@@ ine a world with better air quality , better quality of life and better quality of living for everyone including our future generations .
and just like that , i went from being a woman that these kids would have been trained to see as &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; disabled &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; to somebody that had potential that their bodies didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t have yet .
and interestingly , from an identity standpoint , what does it mean to have a disability ?
so wh@@ im@@ sy matters .
thank you .
so after being interro@@ gated by this japanese manager for a half an hour , he finally said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; so , miss yang , do you have any questions to ask me ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
so today i want to talk about young people through the platform of social media .
first of all , most of them were born in the 80s and 90s , under the one-@@ child policy .
so for the past few years , the coastal areas , they found themselves in a shortage of labor .
while young people seem to be very sure about their participation in public polic@@ y-@@ making , but sometimes they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re a little bit lost in terms of what they want for their personal life .
and our younger generation are going to transform this country while at the same time being transformed themselves .
these mountains are dangerous places , but ultimately the fate of these bear families , and indeed that of all bears around the north pacific , depends on the salmon .
necessity is the mother of evolution .
but just looking up with the naked eye , you really don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t need one .
a culture which is top-@@ down , owned , where the vocal chor@@ ds of the millions have been lost .
now , as@@ cap said they didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t care .
i want to share all my love with you ...
the extremism on one side be@@ gets extremism on the other , a fact we should have learned many , many times over , and both extremes in this debate are just wrong .
we can only make them , quote , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; pirates . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; and is that good ?
because we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re far from home , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re very tired . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
so i know it may sound like tough love , but look , if at some point you got lied to , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s because you agreed to get lied to .
if you don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t want to be decei@@ ved , you have to know , what is it that you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re hungry for ?
lying has evolutionary value to us as a species .
the rest of us , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re only 54 percent accurate .
we all chatter with our finger@@ tips .
they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to be infuri@@ ated if they sense they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re wrongly accused throughout the entire course of the interview , not just in flashes ; they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll be infuri@@ ated throughout the entire course of the interview .
your new joint venture partner might shake your hand , celebrate , go out to dinner with you and then leak an expression of anger .
don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t be too aggressive , it doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t work .
but you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got to ask yourself in the meantime : who do you want on your side of the meeting , someone who &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s trained in getting to the truth or some guy who &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s going to drag a 400-@@ pound electro@@ en@@ cep@@ hal@@ o@@ gram through the door ?
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s downhill from now on . i wanted to thank eme@@ ka and chris .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s very important .
nigeria got its independence in 1960 .
so i had a very in@@ ventive teacher , a pakistani muslim , who wanted to teach us about this .
and fraser &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s on his knees , arms tied behind his back , and he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s crying .
and i watched them being locked up in prison and tear gas@@ sed .
my friend ronald gottes@@ man says there are three kinds of people in the world : those who can count , and those who can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t .
one of my favorite parts of my job at the gates foundation is that i get to travel to the developing world , and i do that quite regularly .
they tap into local entrepreneurial talent , and they do incredible marketing .
and they decided in 1990 that they wanted to start training the local entrepreneurs , giving them small loans .
now the reason these micro-@@ entrepreneurs can sell or make a profit is they have to sell every single bottle in their push@@ cart or their wheel@@ bar@@ row .
and i think that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a mistake .
we know that circum@@ ci@@ sion reduces hiv infection by 60 percent in men .
well on september 4th , there was a huge mo@@ p-@@ up campaign , which is what you do in polio .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to tell you two things today : one is what we have lost , and two , a way to bring it back .
this is where you can see most of the florida keys national marine sanctuary .
but still , now we have global warming .
and this is what i saw , lots of fish .
so the fishermen are catching more .
so how much of this do we have ?
which takes us to the third reason , why we don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t have many more reserves , is that the funding models have been wrong .
so , basically , the production surplus of these guys down there is enough to maintain this biom@@ ass that is not moving .
and there , only there , you really feel that you are part of a larger thing or of a larger global ecosystem .
we use the submarine al@@ vin and we use cameras , and the cameras are something that bill lange has developed with the help of sony .
they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re very little understood .
and there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s tens of thousands of those mountains out there that haven &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t been ma@@ pped yet .
what we find out now is that it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s probably coming from inside the earth .
there are never any lights there , except the lights that we bring .
they don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t need the sun at all .
bl : this bacteria that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve been talking about turns out to be the most simple@@ st form of life found .
el nino comes and goes . it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not a disaster , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s rhyth@@ mic .
this is what we would love students to retain , even if they don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t go into mathemati@@ cal fields .
i believe in real life .
and then as we start to define what does ste@@ ep@@ ness mean , we realize it would be nice to have some measurements to really narrow it down , specifically what that means .
how long will it take it to fill it up ?
and why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher right now is because we have the tools to create this high-quality curriculum in our front pocket .
the lesson of brian &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s presentation , in a way -- all those fantastic pictures -- is this really : that vantage point determines everything that you see .
it was boring .
so the challenges of education in this kind of place are not to learn the kings and queens of kenya or britain .
what do they look like ?
waiting 10 years for the pay@@ off from education is too long when you need to meet daily needs , when you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got siblings to look after or a business to help with .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s one city .
and there will be no mistakes . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d need millions and millions of teachers in china , india , nigeria and the rest of developing world to meet need .
but it is , unlike cars , which have developed so rapidly and orderly , actually the school system is recogni@@ z@@ ably an inheritance from the 19th century , from a bis@@ marki@@ an model of german schooling that got taken up by english reform@@ ers , and often by religious mission@@ aries , taken up in the united states as a force of social cohesion , and then in japan and south korea as they developed .
so as i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m watching this , i see this powerful scene that brought me to tears , and it stuck with me for the past 25 years .
and because i have a 15-year-old , all i do is cook and cook and cook .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s really scary , this gay lifestyle thing ; it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s super du@@ per evil and there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s no end to it !
the u.s. constitution is the gay agenda .
but when you see the map , and you see our state of michigan -- it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s legal to fire someone for being gay , lesbian , bisexual or trans@@ gen@@ dered , that it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s legal to remove someone from their home because they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re gay , lesbian , bisexual or trans@@ gen@@ dered , then you realize that this whole conversation about marriage equality is not about stripping someone &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s rights away , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s about granting them the rights that &@@ #@@ 9@@ 1@@ ; have &@@ #@@ 93@@ ; already been stated .
thank you .
some of the studies even say we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re happier .
entro@@ py means that everything in the world , everything , is in a state of decline and deca@@ y , the arch .
how was i supposed to live it ?
if however , we can go back and alter our relationship , re-@@ vision our relationship to past people and events , ne@@ ural pathways can change .
i know what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s on your mind when you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re looking at these pictures .
they have to try and attract pollin@@ ators to do their bidding .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a wonderful , amazing thing .
this is the phi@@ lo@@ den@@ dron sell@@ ou@@ m .
last week i took these pictures of rock rose , heli@@ an@@ the@@ mum , in dorset .
maybe you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re ticked off , or maybe you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re looking forward to a new game . you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve been up too late playing a game .
and he goes all around the country taking pictures of himself , and you can see here he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s got zig &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s indian reservation . and this particular shot , this is one of the more traditional shots . this is a rain dancer .
and she says , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; they want to go . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; and i said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; honey , no they don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t want to go . this is the middle passage .
this is a game with 50,000 individual pieces .
what you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re looking at is airplane traffic over north america for a 24-hour period .
you see the holding patterns that start to develop in the bottom of the screen .
so they made this web service and said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; any program@@ mer can write a piece of software and tap into the minds of thousands of people . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
that gives you an idea of the different types of motivations and dedication .
so we took a hundred dollar bill and divided it into 10,000 teen@@ y pieces , and we fed those into the mechanical turk .
you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d be fed a simple audio clip .
but we knew we really needed the right person to kind of rally behind and build something for .
ak : so if you go to the website john@@ ny@@ cash@@ proje@@ ct@@ .com , what you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll see is the video playing above .
win butler : now our lives are changing fast now our lives are changing fast hope that something pure can last hope that something pure can last o@@ oh we used to wait o@@ oh we used to wait o@@ oh we used to wait sometimes it never came sometimes it never came still moving through the pain we used to wait for it we used to wait for it we used to wait for it ak : so i think , if there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s one thing to take away from my talk today , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s that an interface can be a powerful narrative device .
and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s also just getting to the essential of things .
so if you don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t know one of these languages , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s instant learning .
here it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; can@@ dy@@ city . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and parallel to my cutting is my running .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not autobio@@ graphical identities .
so for the subway in new york , i saw a correspondence between riding the subway and reading .
so it acts as a screen to protect the rail and the commuter , and not to have objects falling on the rails .
b@@ é@@ atri@@ ce cor@@ on : stories cut from paper
now , the opposite of a sno@@ b is your mother .
envy , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a real taboo to mention envy , but if there is one dominant emotion in modern society , that is envy .
there is another reason why we might be feeling more anxious , about our careers , about our status in the world today , than ever before .
but i think it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s insane to believe that we will ever make a society that is genuinely mer@@ it@@ oc@@ r@@ atic . it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s an impossible dream .
now is there any alternative to this ?
and so we tend to worship ourselves .
psycho@@ analysis has been dru@@ mming home this message for about 80 years .
because otherwise it can get quite clau@@ stro@@ pho@@ bic .
and i decided the remedy to all this malai@@ se was going to be for me to chase an elevated dream , an extreme dream , something that would require utter conviction and unwavering passion , something that would make me be my best self in every aspect of my life , every minute of every day , because the dream was so big that i couldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t get there without that kind of behavior and that kind of conviction .
the navigation is difficult .
and i couldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t wait to trip the mind fantastic .
and every one of those bar@@ bs is sending that ven@@ om into this central nervous system .
and i sw@@ am through the night and i sw@@ am through the next day .
and a little kid from the back was like this .
yeah .
thank you . thank you .
and what about sleep ?
this is a device that not only measures cardiac rhythm , as you saw already , but it also goes well beyond that .
that looks like this .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s usually 90 percent . so , you tell me you sleep better than expected .
now , diabetes is one of the big ones .
there are two things that can really accelerate this whole process .
so , i hope i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve convinced you of this , of the impact on hospital clinic resources is profound and then the impact on diseases is equally impressive across all these different diseases and more .
how do we make stable societies ? longevity .
and you get to think about yourself and your memories , and before you go back into suspension , you edit your memories and you change your personality and so forth .
and , of course , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re not responsible for the consequences of what we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re doing now , are we ? like all this complaint about c@@ lones .
thank you .
so we tried , and i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll show you what we came up with .
so you can lavish all the same care , all the same technique , on a hamburger as you would on some much more fancy dish .
so it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s very much like in a hollywood movie where a guy flies through the air , supported by wires , and then they take the wires away digitally so you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re flying through the air .
that horn-@@ shaped region is what we call the sweet spot .
and because people watch myth@@ busters and c@@ si , i thought , well , let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s put in a recipe for a balli@@ stics ge@@ latin .
but maybe if i cut a hole in his head i can fix it . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
i mean who would put themselves through that ?
la@@ paro@@ scopy is doing this kind of surgery : surgery with long instruments through small inci@@ sions .
and now , in contrast to the la@@ paro@@ scopy , you can precisely place the needle in your instruments , and you can pass it all the way through and follow it in a trajectory .
and you need to re-@@ set it up .
we get to write the script of the next revolution in surgery .
we can heal the disease .
we realized that when plastics get to the dump , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s difficult to sort them because they have similar den@@ si@@ ties , and when they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re mixed with organic matter and construction debris , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s truly impossible to pick them out and environmentally eliminate them .
not only do ph@@ thal@@ ates pollu@@ te our environment , but they also pollu@@ te our bodies .
this means that our bacteria were actually living off of ph@@ thal@@ ates .
thank you . j@@ y : thank you .
but people live on this land .
this is an unusual installation of airport seating .
its early version had an &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; x &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; base . that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what the collectors like .
here &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a film we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve been hearing things about .
so we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to watch another film .
so , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; i saw many trains and also rode on one .
and there are a lot of fun things . this is the museum of the bench .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s about how you approach problems . and there is this huge , beautiful common@@ ality between design , business and the world .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what we all need to do .
it was mind-@@ blowing .
but if corruption cree@@ ps in and people don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t have the opportunity to have that protection of the rule of law , then if you can use violence , if you can use violence with impunity , you can reach out and harvest the vulnerable into slavery .
so , that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a scenario that we think we should be capitali@@ zing on .
these young boys are in nepal .
liberation , however , costs some money .
children rescued from slavery in the fishing industry in ghana , reunited with their parents , and then taken with their parents back to their villages to rebuild their economic well-being so that they become sla@@ ve-@@ proof -- absolutely un@@ ensla@@ ve@@ able .
however , only recently , due to several technological advan@@ cements , we are now able to demonstrate to you quantum le@@ vit@@ ation and quantum locking .
well , first there are strands of magnetic field left inside , but now the super@@ conductor doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t like them moving around , because their movements dissi@@ pate energy , which breaks the super@@ condu@@ ctivity state .
now , i can extend this circular magnet , and make whatever track i want .
and it was also inspired by this quote from douglas adams , and the situation is from &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; the hitch@@ hi@@ ker &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s guide to the galaxy . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
but anyway , i got my suitcase of iron ore and dragged it back to london on the train , and then was faced with the problem : okay , how do you make this rock into components for a to@@ aster ?
and the last material i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to talk about today is plastic , and , of course , my to@@ aster had to have a plastic case .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s it without the case on .
when i was a student at mit , we all shared one computer that took up a whole building .
so we updated them , so i could present it here , to 2007 .
communication technologies : 50 different ways to measure this , the number of bits being moved around , the size of the internet .
and we will begin to actually deeply influence our health and our intelligence , as we get closer and closer to this technology .
this was in an area called wel@@ law@@ atta , a prime residential area in colombo .
for hours afterwards , the sea was strewn with bits of wood for miles around -- all of this was from the houses in the s@@ lum .
voice 1 : it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s coming again . voice 2 : new wave ?
and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s one that offers really interesting possibilities for organizing a whole host of activities down the road .
it is very easy to fall in love with the de@@ centralized , bott@@ om@@ -up structure of the internet .
and there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s this famous example of one that was 1,200 feet long and lasted for two days , and the ants just kept marching around and around in a circle until they died .
i keep thinking about these kids with no arms .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to show you a guy doing a couple of simple things with this that we demonstrated in washington . can we look at this thing ?
it all began when two scientists , fred grass@@ le and jesse ausu@@ bel , met in woods hole , massachusetts where both were guests at the famed oce@@ ano@@ graphic institute .
and with sal@@ ting , it became possible to store fish and to transport it long distances .
and so one of the tools that we can use to sample the oceans is acou@@ stics , or sound waves .
well what they found was mis@@ labeled fish .
this is something we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve actually known for a while , so it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not a real breakthrough .
but the really interesting thing about it is that , a few years ago , census scientists discovered that this guy can thrive in oxy@@ gen-@@ poor sedi@@ ments in the deep mediterranean sea .
so we still have quite a lot of work to do in terms of un@@ know@@ ns .
and the oceans are so productive , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s so much going on in there that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s of relevance to humans that we really need to , even from a selfish perspective , try to do better than we have in the past .
and we do something different than what we did in the past ; we add kind of a mo@@ dic@@ um of intelligence to that .
you know , i am so bad at tech that my daughter -- who is now 41 -- when she was five , was over@@ heard by me to say to a friend of hers , if it doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t bleed when you cut it , my daddy doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t understand it .
the indo-@@ european root of the word hope is a stem , k-@@ e-@@ u -- we would spell it k-@@ e-@@ u ; it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s pronounced ko@@ y -- and it is the same root from which the word curve comes from .
and i think that it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s going to be , in time , the elements of the human spirit that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve been hearing about bit by bit by bit from so many of the speakers in the last few days .
we are , should be , morally committed to being the heal@@ er of the world .
now that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not quite true . there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s one other way , and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s through sweating .
now why is that top problem so easy and the bottom problem so hard ?
you send a command down , it causes muscles to contract .
so what are beliefs ?
and what bay@@ es &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; rule says is that i should multi@@ ply the numbers on the red by the numbers on the green to get the numbers of the yellow , which have the elli@@ pses , and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s my belief .
now there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s good reason to believe that you would want to be able to distinguish external events from internal events .
as you go from 0.1 to 0.2 , it becomes more tick@@ lish at the end .
we started with a motor with a little lever , a little force trans@@ fu@@ ser .
so i have a huge amount of choice to make .
if i choose a different way of moving -- on the right for example -- then i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll have a different command , different noise , playing through a noisy system , very complicated .
you have to study vision with the realization of how the movement system is going to use vision .
and yes , the red planet is red .
here are some recent images .
and what we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re looking at is the presence of the gas methane , ch@@ 4 , in the atmosphere of mars .
in the southern hemisphere there are impact crat@@ ers , there are volcanic crat@@ ers .
we will fly where the methane is .
we believe that in a one-@@ hour flight we can rewrite the text@@ book on mars by making high-@@ resolution measurements of the atmosphere , looking for gases of bio@@ genic origin , looking for gases of volcanic origin , studying the surface , studying the magne@@ tism on the surface , which we don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t understand , as well as about a dozen other areas .
if you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re interested in more information , we have a website that describes this exciting and intriguing mission , and why we want to do it .
i was like , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; yeah .
then you notice that if that le@@ go-@@ provided c@@ ad program isn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t enough , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s an entire open-@@ source , third-party , independent lego c@@ ad program that lets you do 3d modeling and 3d rendering and make , in fact , movies out of lego , 3d films of which there are thousands on youtube , and some of them sort of mimi@@ cking famous films and some totally original content -- just beautiful -- and people re@@ creating all sorts of things .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m really scared . i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t think we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to make it .
so , look what they did .
but the pay-@@ off is really enormous .
california em@@ its only seven percent of u.s. co2 emissions .
every year a million and a half people die of a completely preventable disease . that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s malaria . 6,000 people a day .
do you know , they only invested 0.2 percent of revenues in r &@@ amp@@ ; amp ; d ?
it could be the biggest economic opportunity of the 21st century .
every dot is a person .
because , as i said , we live our lives in networks , and these networks have a particular kind of a structure .
so , if we want to track something that was spreading through a network , what we ideally would like to do is to set up sensors on the central individuals within the network , including no@@ de a , monitor those people that are right there in the middle of the network , and somehow get an early detection of whatever it is that is spreading through the network .
so , we thought we would exploit this idea in order to study whether we could predict phen@@ omena within networks .
and the size of the dots is going to be proportional to how many of their friends have the flu .
and the answer is no .
and there are three ways , i think , that these massi@@ ve-@@ passive data can be used .
over the past seven years , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve been following my fascination with the built environment , and for those of you who know me , you would say that this obsession has led me to live out of a suitcase 365 days a year .
and you even find a church .
today , they live in this area , approximately 50,000 to 70,000 people , who live in this community of self-@@ built multi-@@ story houses where up to three generations live in one structure .
in a region famous for the soft , por@@ ous lo@@ ess plateau soil , there lived until recently an estimated 40 million people in these houses underground .
so you know how it ended up , spencer tracy brought a computer , a main@@ frame computer of 1957 , in to help the libr@@ arians .
on the right are some tu@@ gs from a company called a@@ eth@@ on in pittsburgh .
so a person that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s interacting with the robot understands where it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s going to reach and isn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t surprised by its motions .
mil@@ dre@@ d &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a factory worker in connecticut .
and turned up the other way , the people who are retirement age goes up very , very fast , as the baby boom@@ ers get to retirement age .
the system measures the beam &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s time of flight , recording the time it takes for the light to hit a surface and make its return .
and here , this is a fly-@@ through the cloud of points of tik@@ al , and here you see it rendered and photo@@ -@@ tex@@ tured with the photography that we take of the site .
last march , we received very sad news .
ben kac@@ yra : ancient wonders captured in 3d
we had holocaust education in the schools .
it will refer you directly to your congre@@ s@@ sperson , to your u.s. senator , to your governor where di@@ vest@@ ment legislation is pending .
european governments , for the most part , haven &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t acknowledged responsibility , and there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s nothing to kind of to push back and up against .
he was bobby kenne@@ d@@ y-@@ like because in some ways one could never tell if he was a re@@ alist mas@@ quer@@ ading as an ide@@ alist or an ide@@ alist mas@@ quer@@ ading as a re@@ alist , as people always wondered about bobby kennedy and john kennedy in that way .
but , u@@ h-@@ oh , the killers are within the camps .
you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re un-@@ owned .
don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t black-@@ box history . don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t check your principles at the door .
fourth and final point : he somehow , because he was working in all the world &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s worst places and all lesser evi@@ ls , had a humility , of course , and an awareness of the complexity of the world around him .
some are driven by compassion , feel it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s perhaps one of the fundamental acts of humanity .
a hundred years ago , we didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t .
and yet , in many places , a third of the children , by the time they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re three already are facing a life of hardship due to this .
and these types of technologies , i see , have the potential to transform the face of hunger and nutrition , malnutrition out on the front lines .
well two years ago , we decided , let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s transform the model of fighting hunger , and instead of giving out the food aid , we put it into food banks .
it is a win-@@ win-@@ win situation that starts the food economy moving .
well , the world bank estimates it would take about 10 billion dollars -- 10.@@ 3 -- to address malnutrition in those countries .
so , this is an asto@@ unding table .
as one gets older ? very , very common .
why ? because we know what you have , and we know how to treat it -- although we can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t make vaccine in this country , but that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a different story .
and i think that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s been the fundamental problem over the last five decades , is that we have stri@@ ved to understand cancer .
and so , if you think of cancer as a system , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s an input and an output and a state in the middle .
if i give a woman with breast cancer a drug called tax@@ ol every three weeks , which is the standard , about 40 percent of women with meta@@ static cancer have a great response to that drug .
so , instead of a redu@@ ction@@ ist view , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re taking a step back .
the problem is that , if i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m this doc , and i get your ct scan today and you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got a two centi@@ meter mass in your liver , and you come back to me in three months and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s three centi@@ meters , did that drug help you or not ?
and so , as a cancer doctor , instead of having paper in my chart , in your chart , and it being this thick , this is what data flow is starting to look like in our offices , where that drop of blood is creating gigab@@ y@@ tes of data .
most people find that very soothing , and , interestingly , 12 cycles per minute is roughly the frequency of the breathing of a sleeping human .
so if i were to play this -- -- for more than a few seconds , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d feel uncomfortable ; for more than a few minutes , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d be leaving the room in dro@@ ves .
you all recognize that one . this is the most-@@ played tune in the world today .
and i stood there beside two very good friends of mine , richard weber and kevin vall@@ ely .
so we would have a live website , that every single day of the 33 days , we would be blo@@ gging , telling stories of , you know , depleted o@@ zone forcing us to cover our faces , or we will burn .
that i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m this uber-@@ endurance guy ?
i actually love diving at night ; you see a lot of fish then that you don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t see in the daytime .
no matter where on earth you live .
we can go actually and swim around on google earth and visit with hum@@ p@@ back whales .
we kill using long lines , with ba@@ ited hooks every few feet that may stretch for 50 miles or more .
and , in 1972 , this nation began to establish a counterpart in the sea , national marine sanctu@@ aries .
but , nothing else will matter if we fail to protect the ocean .
without insects , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d be no flo@@ wering plants .
they have another set of eyes on the top of their head .
a mouse has about 1,000 times as many neurons as a fly .
and these are the two concepts i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d like to explore .
so this is the preparation that one of my former post-@@ do@@ cs , gaby ma@@ im@@ on , who &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s now at rock@@ ef@@ eller , developed , and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s basically a flight simulator but under conditions where you actually can stick an electro@@ de in the brain of the fly and record from a gene@@ tically identified neur@@ on in the fly &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s brain .
the first is , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s essential for us to understand the human brain if we do want to get along in society , and i think that it is a key step in evolution .
so i can say , with some certainty , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; i think , therefore i am . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re just packing in columns , so that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d have more neo@@ cor@@ tical columns to perform more complex functions .
and we did that for tens of thousands of neurons , built digital models of all the different types of neurons we came across .
and when we do that what we discovered is that the circu@@ it@@ ry does change .
now , when you look at that the first time , you think , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; my god . how is reality coming out of that ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
this took place in my childhood -- 1957 to &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; 65 .
&@@ quo@@ t@@ ; space@@ ship project officially begun . job waiting for you . dyson . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
so , these are three-@@ pound charges of c@@ 4 ; that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s about 10 times what the guy had in his shoes .
this is a 20 man version for going to jupiter : bun@@ ks , storm cell@@ ars , exercise room .
you know , i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t know how many of those you read , but it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not fun to read and often not fun to write -- even worse to write .
which i think is just fascinating .
very very hard .
giving your organs to somebody else is probably about how much you care about society , how linked you are .
interestingly enough , when people get this , they again don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t check -- but now they join .
this is from a paper by re@@ del@@ meier and scha@@ efer .
there is one more decision .
a print subscription for 125 .
and because we don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t know our preferences that well we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re susceptible to all of these influences from the external forces : the defaul@@ ts , the particular options that are presented to us , and so on .
the silver lining is , i think , kind of the reason that behavioral economics is interesting and exciting .
they are scarce ; they are expensive ; and we only have a certain range of it .
and then we have the radio waves , they have the issues i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve just mentioned .
and this is a fundamental basic property that we exploit with our technology .
you think , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; ha , ha , ha .
and then i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve mentioned the availability .
and then you have these millions of street la@@ mps deployed around the world .
you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve heard of dna ; you probably studied a little bit in biology .
and look at all the complex things and wonderful things we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve been able to create with just a one and a zero .
and then james watson &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s -- one of the co-@@ founders of dna -- genome was done for two million dollars , and in just two months .
an architect far better and smarter than us has given us that tool@@ box , and we now have the ability to use it .
we could produce better flavors and arom@@ as .
and he had the best answer i ever heard to this question : &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; well , somebody has to . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m sni@@ ffing this other dog &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s rear end , the owner &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s calling . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and what you will find is a very , very low-@@ ranking bitch will quite easily keep a bone away from a high-ranking male .
and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s how we use the food lure in the hand , and we use food because we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re dealing with owners .
so we go , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; sit , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; on the couch ; &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; sit , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; tum@@ m@@ y-@@ rub ; &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; sit , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; look , i throw a tennis ball ; &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; sit , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; say hello to that other dog .
they think a punishment is something nasty .
your head now is 100 yards away , sailing through the air , ok ?
and ugly face is this -- when you go face-to-face with a puppy or a child , you say , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; what are you doing ! now stop it , stop it , stop it ! &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
it really is .
speaking at the 2007 eg conference , trainer ian dun@@ bar asks us to see the world through the eyes of our beloved dogs . by knowing our pets &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; perspective , we can build their love and trust . it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a message that reson@@ ates well beyond the animal world .
and you made it out of what ?
wk : yeah , i want to build another one -- to pump water and irrigation for crops .
and so this is basically a song about lo@@ ops , but not the kind of lo@@ ops that i make up here .
and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what the song is asking .
every time i read che@@ kho@@ v and his unique vision of human life , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m reminded of why i too became a writer .
what about bigger numbers ?
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a lot easier than the way that the school taught you to do math , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m sure .
the hare itself , the animal -- not a cat , not a dog , a hare -- why a hare ?
how did we become the only species that becomes more prosperous as it becomes more populous ?
and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s this combination , this cumulative technology , that intri@@ gues me , because i think it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the secret to understanding what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s happening in the world .
there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s no exchange of ideas between them .
and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s seven and a half seconds of prosperity that you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve gained since 1950 , as it were , because that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else , or you can acquire another good or service .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re able to draw upon speci@@ alization and exchange to raise each other &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s living standards .
and so both sides raise each other &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s standards of living through the sexual division of labor .
and that will have led to speci@@ alization .
the person on the assembly line doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t know because he doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t know how to drill an oil well to get oil out to make plastic , and so on .
my work is about the behaviors that we all engage in un@@ consciously , on a collective level .
and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s gone up since then , but we don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t have the numbers yet .
and this is what the next piece is about .
as we try to build this view , and try to educate ourselves about the enor@@ mity of our culture , the information that we have to work with is these gigantic numbers : numbers in the millions , in the hundreds of millions , in the billions and now in the trilli@@ ons .
you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re looking at the outside shell of the virus , and the yellow color here are those parts of the virus that are evolving very , very fast , and the blue parts are not evolving very fast .
but really , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s pretty robust .
and there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re only 102 because people got bored collecting them : there are just new ones every year .
so that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s great , but again , cheap shot , right ?
we put the bee@@ per in the clinic .
i mean , they went to the max for this woman .
and what i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m telling you here from the signal , is that men who have a mutation in this antiviral defense enzy@@ me , and have a tumor , often have -- 40 percent of the time -- a signature which reveals a new retro@@ virus .
joe der@@ isi : solving medical mysteries
here &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the first battery -- a stack of coins , zin@@ c and silver , separated by cardboard soaked in br@@ ine .
the electro@@ ly@@ te is not a solution of salt and water , but rather salt that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s melted .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s pretty cool , at least in theory .
so a year and a half ago , david and i , along with another research staf@@ f-@@ member , formed a company to accelerate the rate of progress and the race to manufacture product .
donald sa@@ do@@ way : the missing link to renewable energy
so i want to give you a quick story of how it got started .
did you find the gold ?
things where you might trip across things like the co@@ perni@@ can principle , the fer@@ mi paradox , the anthro@@ pic principle , the origin of life .
so pretty much players are encouraged to be very creative in the game .
so this is the planet that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve been playing on up to this point in the game .
now here , our entire oceans are evapor@@ ating off the surface , and as it keeps getting hotter at some point the entire planet &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s going to melt down .
and so you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d have this wonderful sparkling thing , with the dis@@ k slowly rotating , and this is roughly what it would look like . and so really , part of this is about bringing the beauty of this , of the natural world , to somebody in a very imagin@@ ative way , so that they can start cali@@ br@@ ating their instinct across these vast scales of space and time .
even the bbc and the new york times .
so they do this both when they have power sort of chroni@@ cally , and also when they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re feeling powerful in the moment .
so business schools have been struggling with this gender grade gap .
probably not , right ? you want the person who &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s powerful and asser@@ tive and dominant , but not very stress re@@ active , the person who &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s laid back .
so two minutes lead to these hormon@@ al changes that confi@@ g@@ ure your brain to basically be either asser@@ tive , confident and comfortable , or really stre@@ ss-@@ re@@ active , and , you know , feeling sort of shut down . and we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve all had the feeling , right ?
we also evaluate these people much more positively overall . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and the night before my first-year talk , and the first-year talk at princeton is a 20-@@ minute talk to 20 people . that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s it .
two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
so you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re out in the woods , or you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re out in the pa@@ sture , and you see this ant craw@@ ling up this blade of grass .
many people have laid down their lives for commun@@ ism , and many have laid down their lives for capitalism .
now , what theories do we want to use to look at this ?
not silicon .
there are other parasi@@ tes that do this -- which render the host steri@@ le .
they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re not a big deal for us .
now in the old days , conducting , music making , was less about trust and more , frankly , about coerci@@ on .
i have to say , in those days , i couldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t really even find the bird .
they don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t read music .
do you hear it ?
well done , ladies and gentlemen .
lyn : when i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m making music , i feel like a pilot in the cockpit flying an airplane .
my uncle ed gave me a beautiful blue sweater -- at least i thought it was beautiful .
we focused on a business model ; we insisted on skin in the game .
they are farmers and factory workers .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s estimated that africa loses about 13 billion dollars a year to the disease .
she runs two of the lines , and has already saved enough money to put a down payment on her house .
well three sons got into a negotiation .
how do we deal with our deepest differences , given the human pro@@ pen@@ sity for conflict and the human genius at devi@@ sing weapons of enormous destruction ?
and we can play an incredibly constructive role .
now let me take you for a moment to what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s widely regarded as the world &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s most difficult conflict , or the most impossible conflict , is the middle east .
now as anthrop@@ ologists , we know that every culture has an origin story .
and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what comes to the first step here .
let me ask you a question .
and so that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s about .
but they did it thanks to a common identity -- europe -- and a common economy .
natalie mac@@ master : cape bre@@ ton fi@@ ddling in reel time
first step , the medical doctor went away for about six months , and he worked on what were to become these nine health goals , what were we aiming at .
you and your kids are fine .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s our average budget .
they do all aspects of the work .
they could trap the flies , send them to him in perth .
i put it to you , is this eliminating poverty ?
so when i do my job , people hate me .
and second , i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t care about the word , i care about how you use it .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m not saying it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s easy .
but it all starts with seeds in classrooms , in my place , which looks like this .
and what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d we do then ? well , i met nice people like you , and they invited us to the ham@@ pt@@ ons .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a picture i took of my bronx borough president , addressing my kids in his house , not the ja@@ il@@ house , making them feel a part of it .
so we started giving back .
and when you expand their pal@@ ates , you expand their vo@@ cab@@ ulary .
and again , when you can take kids from backgrounds as diverse as this to do something as special as this , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re really creating a moment .
people , you can all do that .
s@@ í se pu@@ ede !
well , with the pig , at the baseline , before we blocked the pig &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s ar@@ tery to simul@@ ate a heart attack , that was the signal .
so there it was , thursday morning we stopped the pig &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s medication and there is his electro@@ gram , the signal from inside the pig &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s heart coming out by radio tele@@ me@@ try .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the first invention that i wanted to describe .
st@@ acy sa@@ ger : but for christina side@@ bottom , almost anything was worth trying if it could stop a migra@@ ine .
this is probably a better picture .
a signal in the brain that triggers brain dysfunction might be sen@@ sed as a trigger for electro@@ -@@ stimulation like we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re doing with epilep@@ sy .
everybody knows that we can do better with a visual thing that can be interactive with the patient , where they see the video and they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re being video@@ ed and they press , do you understand this ? no , i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t .
and so there is a team of developers from all over africa , who are part of this team now -- from ghana , from malawi , from kenya .
you see this with twitter , too . you get this information over@@ load .
after he died , i realized that no one writes to me anymore .
in fact , so many different points of reson@@ ance that it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s going to be difficult to bring them all up , but i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll try to do my best .
think of it as a massive it@@ unes for book type content .
companies like national instruments , who are embed@@ ding very powerful , interactive simul@@ ations into the materials , so that we can go way beyond our regular kind of text@@ book to an experience that all the teaching materials are things you can actually interact with and play around with and actually learn as you do .
so what we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re seeing is moving this burning or publication process from the regular sort of single-@@ authored book towards community-@@ authored materials that are modular , that are customi@@ zed to each individual class and published on demand very in@@ expen@@ sively , either pushed out through amazon , or published directly through an on-@@ demand press , like co@@ op .
and people who are teachers out here , whoever taught , you know this -- it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the inter@@ connections between ideas that teaching is really all about .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re not talking about harry potter , right ?
and if you read the press , it actually last week said i quit the media lab .
and these are two anecdo@@ tes -- one was in cambodia , in a village that has no electricity , no water , no television , no telephone , but has broadband internet now .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re interested in big displays , bright displays .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the rest -- that little brown box -- that is pretty fascinating , because the rest of your laptop is devoted to itself .
is it all worked out ? no .
by law you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got to bid , and so on and so forth .
because there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s no market for post office trucks .
and if it comes out at 138 dollars , so what ?
we can put anything we want into it , and it doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t get heavier , and then we can take anything out .
and i said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; i want to do that . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
these are the people that you have access to right now , in general -- all of these people , all of your friends and family that you can connect to .
i want you to take a trip with me .
in re@@ sour@@ ce-@@ rich countries , with all the tests and treatment we currently have , less than two percent of babies are born hiv-@@ positive -- 98 percent of babies are born hiv-@@ negative .
these women are here for care , but we know that just doing a test , just giving someone a drug , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not enough .
your baby is going to be hiv-@@ negative . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
the second : keep mothers healthy , keep mothers alive , keep the children alive -- no more orphan@@ s .
she had been asked by one of the clients to go to the home of the client , because the client wanted to tell the mother and her brothers and sisters about her hiv status , and she was afraid to go by herself .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve chosen to re@@ define the health care system as a doctor , a nurse and a mentor mother .
mothers with hiv caring for mothers with hiv .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s propor@@ tionally much bigger in humans than in any other species , and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s involved in a whole range of high level cognitive functions , things like decision-making , planning , planning what you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to do tomorrow or next week or next year , inhi@@ biting inappropriate behavior , so stopping yourself saying something really rude or doing something really stupid .
there are three trucks there . you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to instin@@ ctively go for the white truck , because that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the top truck from your perspective , but then you have to remember , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; oh , he can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t see that truck , so he must mean me to move the blue truck , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; which is the top truck from his perspective . now believe it or not , normal , healthy , intelligent adults like you make errors about 50 percent of the time on that kind of trial .
but now we try to understand that in terms of the development of a part of their brain called the lim@@ bic system , so i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to show you the lim@@ bic system in red in the slide behind me , and also on this brain .
see , he owned a chro@@ mi@@ um plat@@ ing company , and they had to move heavy steel parts between tanks of chemicals , and so he needed an industrial robot like this that could basically do the heavy lifting .
but i knew what he meant , because it would be possible to take a bunch of pictures of flowers in a garden and then , basically , index them in a computer system such that it would appear that there was a real robot when there wasn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t .
she said , when she was just about to walk on stage , the tele@@ -@@ directors were still trying to agree on what to do , and so she just walked on stage and did what felt most natural .
human demonstrations , they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re all noisy and im@@ perfect , and we extract from them an infer@@ red task trajectory and control sequence for the robot .
the more that robots ing@@ rain themselves into our everyday lives , the more we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re forced to examine ourselves as people . at ted@@ x@@ berkeley , ken goldberg shares four very human lessons that he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s learned from working with robots . &@@ amp@@ ; lt ; em &@@ amp@@ ; gt ; &@@ amp@@ ; lt ; / em &@@ amp@@ ; gt ;
in fact , it is said that in the collective consciousness of africa , we get to experience the deepest parts of our own humanity through our interactions with others .
and there was something so beautifully african about it to me , this small house with a huge heart in it .
as i come out of the water , sol@@ ly arrives at a deep section , a channel between us .
she arrived at our reserve from a reserve east of us on her migr@@ atory route .
and while it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s true that u@@ bun@@ tu is an african idea , what i see is the essence of that value being invented here .
now ka@@ e@@ sa@@ va had a baby boy called re@@ han a couple of weeks ago .
perhaps loss of memory is so crucial for our survival as human beings .
well , when i think of the future , i never see myself moving forward in time . i actually see time moving backward towards me .
i actually included stories from my grandmother .
i must admit , i used to be one of them .
i discovered that there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a movement for a better way .
bir@@ ke ba@@ e@@ hr : what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s wrong with our food system
and you can see that it kind of hockey sticks up around the 1960s and &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; 70s , and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s on kind of a nice trajectory right now .
se@@ amounts are important for biodiversity .
and what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the context of the phoenix islands ?
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d like to go back and share it with the government of kiri@@ bat@@ i , who are over in tar@@ awa , the western@@ most group .
it had occurred on land , in rain@@ forests of south america and africa , where landow@@ ners had been paid not to cut the trees down .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s almost like if a person has multiple diseases , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s hard to get well , you might die , but if you only have one disease to deal with , you can get better .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve just described to you the one story behind that rec@@ tan@@ gular area in the middle , the phoenix islands , but every other green patch on that has its own story .
just in the past couple years , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve seen digital tools display skills and abilities that they never , ever had before , and that , kind of , eat deeply into what we human beings do for a living . let me give you a couple examples .
in the short term , we can stimulate job growth by encouraging entrepreneurship and by investing in infrastructure , because the robots today still aren &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t very good at fixing bridges .
so the work of innovation , the work of coming up with new ideas , is some of the most powerful , some of the most fundamental work that we can do in an economy . and this is kind of how we used to do innovation .
thanks very much .
this is 1983 .
and , lastly , under &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; harmony , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; they had this 13@@ th-century man@@ dal@@ a from tibet .
he didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t want any of his friends to be arrested , so he supplied everybody with this fake volunteer card .
which brought me back to my list making -- you know , just to see what i actually like about my job .
then it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s : &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; guts . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
the other condition is in societies living in marginal or fluctu@@ ating environments , such as the arctic or deser@@ ts , where there are periodi@@ c food shortages , and occasionally there just isn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t enough food to keep everyone alive .
for example , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s particular emphasis on respect for the elderly in east asia , associated with confu@@ cius &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; doctrine of fili@@ al pie@@ ty , which means obe@@ di@@ ence , respect and support for elderly parents .
perhaps the biggest change for the worse is that our elderly are obje@@ ctively less useful than in traditional societies .
unfortunately , all of those terrible situations could come back .
those are just some examples of what we can learn from traditional societies .
and so the back@@ story of the 99 takes place in 12@@ 58 , which history tells us the mon@@ gol@@ s invaded baghdad and destroyed it .
the concept centers on something called the no@@ or stones .
i got accused in a few blo@@ gs that i was actually sent by the pope to pre@@ ach the trinity and catholi@@ cism in the middle east , so you -- you believe who you want . i gave you my version of the story .
top right is stuart moore , a writer for iron man .
opened a theme park through a license in kuwait a year and a half ago called the 99 village theme park -- 300,000 square feet , 20 rides , all with our characters : a couple back-to-@@ school licenses in spain and turkey .
i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t deserve it . i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t deserve anything .
and the first one was about a group called the party of god , who wanted to ban valentine &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s day . red was made illegal .
ra@@ yan refra@@ med the situation and brought himself down to my level .
that is , they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re meaningless without context : 500 billion for this pipeline , 20 billion for this war .
so i want to show you another landscape now .
why april ?
yeah , retail therapy might help .
there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s something almost quite magical about visual information .
so massive , in fact , that it can contain all the other military budgets in the world inside itself .
we need relative figures that are connected to other data so that we can see a fuller picture , and then that can lead to us changing our perspective .
so let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s filter that out .
i mean , i find information just too interesting .
now what you are sm@@ elling is a combination of -- i asked how many molecules there were in there , and nobody would tell me .
and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a perfectly reasonable theory in the sense that almost everything else in biology works by shape .
this is ci@@ s-@@ 3-@@ hex@@ ene-@@ 1-@@ ol . it smells of cut grass .
the bad news is they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re rocket fuels .
this is the basis for the device that these two guys at ford built .
and i said , first of all , let me do the calculation on that compound , bottom right , which is related to cou@@ marin , but has an extra pentagon inserted into the molecule .
i come out of the advertising and design business .
running through this typical letter that they had , i ran it through my simplicity lab , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s pretty un@@ intel@@ ligible .
moses ! -- the boys in michael mor@@ pur@@ go &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; friend or foe ; &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; alem in benjamin ze@@ phan@@ iah &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; refugee boy ; &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; luke sky@@ walker -- luke sky@@ walker ! -- oliver twist ; cas@@ sia in &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; the concu@@ bine of shanghai &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; by hong ying ; ce@@ lie in alice walker &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; the color purple . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
the adoption process took , like , a matter of months , so it was a closed shop , you know , sealed deal , an industri@@ ous , utili@@ tarian solution : the government , the farmer , the adopting parents , the consumer , the mother , the earth , and the child , the crop .
and i was on the cus@@ p of , sort of , adolesc@@ ence , so i was starting to take biscuits from the tin without asking .
but because i had no family to in@@ quire about me , they could do anything to me .
lem@@ n si@@ s@@ say : a child of the state
we still really haven &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t got a very complete picture of it .
and if you look north here , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a big river that flows into the lake that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s been carrying sedi@@ ment and preserving the remains of the animals that lived there .
and he remained there until 1.6 million years later , when this very famous fossil hunter , kam@@ o@@ ya ki@@ me@@ u , walked along a small hill@@ side and found that small piece of his skull lying on the surface amongst the pe@@ bbles , recognized it as being hom@@ in@@ id .
i think it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s our collective intelligence .
well , to end on a very positive note , i think evolu@@ tion@@ arily speaking , this is probably a fairly good thing , in the end .
this fol@@ der has 17,000 photos -- over 20 gigab@@ y@@ tes of information -- and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s growing constantly .
you can see that i even made a museum label for it that includes a brief history of the do@@ do .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s funny to me that it took a while to authenti@@ cate it , because i can see it compared to this thing , and i can tell you -- it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s real , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the real thing , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s made from the exact same mold that this one is .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll go you one stranger than that : in 1974 , during the production of a weird comedy sequel to &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; the malte@@ se falcon , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; called &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; the black bird , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; starring george seg@@ al , the los angeles county museum of art had a pla@@ ster original of the malte@@ se falcon -- one of the original six pla@@ sters , i think , made for the movie -- stolen out of the museum . a lot of people thought it was a publicity stunt for the movie .
there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a thing that happens when you mold and cast things , which is that every time you throw it into silicone and cast it in re@@ sin , you lose a little bit of volume , you lose a little bit of size .
i had extensive and life-threatening injuries .
the next concern was whether i would walk again , because i was paraly@@ zed from the waist down .
i was lying on a thin , hard spinal bed .
in the spinal ward , that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s normal .
it was everybody &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s pain . and then i knew , just like before , that i had a choice . i could keep fighting this or i could let go and accept not only my body but the circumstances of my life .
and they took one look and ran out the back to draw short stra@@ ws .
so i went home , i got a training diary out , and i had a plan .
the pilot light inside of me was still a light , just as it is in each and every one of us .
and we should be developing things -- we should be developing packaging for ideas which elevate people &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s perceptions and respect for the things that we dig out of the earth and translate into products for everyday use .
when i do make some money , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll have one mach@@ ined for myself .
it comes back to instinct .
it cost 1.7 million dollars to develop . it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s called &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; go &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; by bern@@ hardt , usa .
that is the power of organic design .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s grown in my mind , and then it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s grown in terms of the whole process that i go through .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve been banging on about this like i can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t believe .
and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what i do with my furniture .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s in not@@ ting hill next to all the crap -- you know , the pro@@ stit@@ utes and all that stuff .
on the wall is my book called &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; supernatural , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; which allows me to remember what i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve done , because i forget .
we trained in a tank in port hu@@ ene@@ me , and then my first open ocean dive was in santa barbara channel .
like those big explosions , sparks , are from a little comb jel@@ ly , and there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s kri@@ ll and other kinds of cru@@ stac@@ e@@ ans , and j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish .
now , this one is blue , and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the color of most bi@@ olu@@ min@@ esc@@ ence in the ocean because evolution has selected for the color that travels far@@ the@@ st through sea@@ water in order to optimi@@ ze communication .
he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s got to find himself a babe and then he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s got to lat@@ ch on for life .
and then to generate the display you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re about to see , all i did was touch it once per second on its nerve ring with a sharp pick that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s sort of like the sharp tooth of a fish .
but there came a moment when it all came together , and everything worked .
edith wid@@ der : glowing life in an underwater world
so as we are facing all the multiple crises in our world at the moment , what is good for us on a personal level , what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s going to bring more joy , gratitude , effectiveness in our lives and be the best for our own careers is also what is best for the world .
so i -- i took my camera , i took my notebook , took a chair , and started to observe this behavior .
here &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s one of my fellow winners . that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s charles paxton who won the 2000 biology prize for his paper , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; cour@@ t@@ ship behavior of o@@ stri@@ ches towards humans under farming conditions in britain . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
the mission@@ ary position is very rare in the animal kingdom .
and when it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s over , we go to a chinese restaurant and we have a six-@@ course duck dinner .
it had become a part of my body , an extension of my senses , and after some time , it even became a part of my official image .
prince charles has some similarities with nicole kid@@ man .
and the good thing about percei@@ ving ultra@@ violet is that you can hear if it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a good day or a bad day to sun@@ ba@@ the , because ultra@@ violet is a dangerous color , a color that can actually kill us , so i think we should all have this wish to perceive things that we cannot perceive .
she was wholly un@@ concerned about the bears , but she was terrified of lawyers .
but the reality is , these crazy cases are relatively rare . they don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t usually win .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s very hard to measure because there are mixed motives .
it doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t seem to be working very well does it ?
people -- for law to be the platform for freedom , people have to trust it .
so , what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s needed now is to rebuild these boundaries .
that person doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t exist today .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the only way to get our freedom back , and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the only way to release the energy and passion needed so that we can meet the challenges of our time . thank you .
or -- or maybe and -- in addition to rules , let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s see if we can come up with some really clever incentives so that , even if the people we deal with don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t particularly want to serve our interests , it is in their interest to serve our interest -- the magic incentives that will get people to do the right thing even out of pure sel@@ fish@@ ness .
well if you think about it , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s really hard to measure out round columns using a ruler .
he had a pretty low-@@ wage job .
he did after all have a toy gun .
but the problem with relying on rules and incentives is that they demor@@ alize professional activity , and they demor@@ alize professional activity in two senses .
so canny out@@ laws are better than nothing , but it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s hard to imagine any canny outlaw sustaining that for an indefin@@ ite period of time .
there are now 22 cities that have veterans &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; courts like this .
so there are lots of examples like this that we talk about .
the united states had developed a couple of atomic weapons through the manhattan project , and the idea was very straightforward : we would use the power of the atom to end the atrocities and the horror of this un@@ ending world war ii that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d been involved in in europe and in the pacific .
during this chapter one , there was a high level of public awareness about the potential of nuclear catastrophe , and an in@@ deli@@ ble image was im@@ planted in our collective minds that , in fact , a nuclear holocaust would be absolutely globally destructive and could , in some ways , mean the end of civilization as we know it .
so the goal was to evacuate the target cities .
there are many , many sites where war@@ heads are stored and , in fact , lots of sites where fi@@ ssi@@ onable materials , like highly enriched uranium and pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um , are absolutely not safe .
they are very dedicated and committed .
this is the size of the &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; little boy &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; bomb that was dropped at hiro@@ shima .
in that 10 to 15 minutes , all you have to do -- and i mean this seriously -- is go about a mile away from the blast .
so separation -- hopefully with dirt or concrete , or being in a basement -- distance and time is what will save you .
serious problems , big problems , pressing problems .
and many of us here are deeply involved in that .
and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s clearer now than it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s been for decades .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what business does when it makes a profit .
business does not profit from causing social problems , actually not in any fundamental sense .
we see companies like the brazilian forestry company fi@@ bria that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s figured out how to avoid tearing down old growth forest and using eu@@ caly@@ p@@ tus and getting much more yield per he@@ ct@@ are of pulp and making much more paper than you could make by cutting down those old trees .
if we can break down this sort of divide , this un@@ ease , this tension , this sense that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re not fundamentally collaborating here in driving these social problems , we can break this down , and we finally , i think , can have solutions .
this shows a lot of internal structures .
it doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t have to be always dis@@ section .
they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re even more shocked by what he says .
they talked about science and the need for a new scientific revolution .
each month required 1,@@ 365 calculations , so these tables were filled with mistakes .
there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a flip side as well .
one day a nasa manager comes into my office , sits down and says , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; can you please tell us , how do we look for life outside earth ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
so he was convinced , but , in fact , most people aren &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t .
and it is in fact due to this arms race between hackers and operating system designers that things go back and forth .
and as you see here , there are groups that are growing on top of each other , because they are spreading .
and obviously each of these letters comes off about roughly equally frequent .
it doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t matter what kind of sedi@@ ment you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re using to grind up , whether it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s bacteria or any other plants or animals .
so let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s see what that looks like .
and if we remove the mystery of life , then i think it is a little bit easier for us to think about how we live , and how perhaps we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re not as special as we always think we are .
this is a paper form , and what you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re looking at is a paper form in the hand of a ministry of health nurse in indonesia who is tramp@@ ing out across the countryside in indonesia on , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m sure , a very hot and hu@@ mid day , and she is going to be knocking on thousands of doors over a period of weeks or months , knocking on the doors and saying , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; excuse me , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d like to ask you some questions .
now try and wrap your head around that for a second .
the problem was , after a few years of doing that , i realized i had done -- i had been to maybe six or seven programs , and i thought , you know , if i keep this up at this pace , over my whole career , maybe i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to go to maybe 20 or 30 programs .
now you may not think of hot@@ mail as being mira@@ culous , but for me it was mira@@ culous , because i noticed , just as i was wrestling with this problem , i was working in sub-saharan africa mostly at the time .
but there are some additional benefits as well .
collecting global health data was an im@@ perfect science : workers tra@@ mped through villages to knock on doors and ask questions , wrote the answers on paper forms , then input the data -- and from this g@@ app@@ y information , countries would make huge decisions . data ge@@ ek joel sel@@ ani@@ kio talks through the sea change in collecting health data in the past decade -- starting with the palm pilot and hot@@ mail , and now moving into the cloud . &@@ amp@@ ; lt ; em &@@ amp@@ ; gt ; &@@ amp@@ ; lt ; / em &@@ amp@@ ; gt ;
and when we drop the bal@@ last over@@ board we climb .
throwing over@@ board , as bal@@ last , to change our direction .
but we were expected to have doubts ; we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re expected to have fears .
but it will not be possible in the future any more .
why that ? because fuel is not easy to replace .
and this is exactly the symbol of our world .
but much more , to get advi@@ ces , to give your comments , to spread the word that if it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s possible in the air , of course it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s possible in the ground .
you see , it used to be that if you wanted to make a record of a song , you needed a studio and a producer .
don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t ask .
and what we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re facing in africa is an unprecedented threat to human dignity and equality .
you see , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not as dramatic as the tsunami .
don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t you think that on a purely commercial level , that anti-@@ retro@@ viral drugs are great advertisements for western in@@ genu@@ ity and technology ?
this is the straight truth , the righ@@ teous truth .
so why , then , are we not pumping our fi@@ sts into the air ?
momentum has been building .
there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the continent africa .
a few minutes ago , i talked about all the citizens &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; campaigns that are spring@@ ing up .
i really believe that old truman line , that if you give the american people the facts , they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll do the right thing .
i think we have the money and brains in the room to do that .
now , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; all shook up &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; is a great love song .
people with colored hearing actually see colors when they hear the sounds of words or letters .
they took longer to reject metaphor@@ s as false than they did to reject literally false sentences .
those exposed to the world war ii scenario made more interven@@ tionist recommendations than the others .
ap@@ hor@@ ism enthusiast and author james ge@@ ary wa@@ x@@ es on a fascinating fixture of human language : the metaphor . friend of scri@@ bes from aristo@@ tle to elvis , metaphor can sub@@ tly influence the decisions we make , ge@@ ary says .
but we want to tell the world that , no , under the one flag , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll still remain as yemeni people .
and he said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; you are the bridge . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
pm : and we should point out that he works with you as well at the paper .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve suffered prosecution ; the paper was closed down more than three times .
actually , that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a documentary that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s available online ; the video &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s online .
as political turmoil in yemen continues , the editor of the yemen times , nadia al-@@ sak@@ ka@@ f , talks at ted@@ global with host pat mitchell . al-@@ sak@@ ka@@ f &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s independent , english-@@ language paper is vital for sharing news -- and for sharing a new vision of yemen and of that country &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s women as equal partners in work and change .
my father and my grandfather were always looking for the newest thing in alternative or traditional therapies for ph , but after six months , i couldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t walk up a small hill . i couldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t climb a flight of stairs .
it certainly didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t prepare me for what came next .
my doctor wanted me to get on the list for a lung transplant .
but organs don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t wait , and i went into surgery before i could say goodbye .
medical conditions don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t neg@@ ate the human condition .
and many of these chemicals are now linked to the skyrocketing incidents of chronic childhood disease that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re seeing across industri@@ alized nations .
and you can see these large , yol@@ ke@@ d-up eggs bursting through the surface of this male &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s testes .
but just two weeks before that , the u.s. senate refused to even debate the banning of b@@ pa in babies &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; bottles and si@@ ppy cups .
in addition to that , after the baby &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s born , our other unique invention as mammals is that we nour@@ ish our offspring after they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re born .
th : one of this things that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s exciting and appropriate for me to be here at ted@@ women is that , well , i think it was summed up best last night at dinner when someone said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; turn to the man at your table and tell them , &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; when the revolution starts , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got your back . &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; the truth is , women , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve had our back on this issue for a very long time , starting with rachel carson &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; silent spring &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; to theo col@@ born &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; our stolen future &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; to sandra stein@@ graber &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s books &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; living downstream &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; and &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; having faith . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s my feeling and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s my urging being here to know that , as we women move forward as the communi@@ cators of this , but also as the ones who carry that burden of carrying the children , bearing the children , we hold most of the buying power in the household , is that it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s going to be us moving forward to carry the work of tyrone and other scientists around the world .
here is a remote island re@@ posi@@ tory for bottles off the coast of ba@@ ja california .
that day i ended up spending nearly 60 .

but cur@@ iously , red@@ wood rain@@ forests , the fragments that we have left , to this day remain under-@@ explored .
and with a friend of his , he took it upon himself to free-@@ climb a red@@ wood without ropes or any equipment to see what was up there .
when steve sil@@ lett gets up into a big red@@ wood , he fires an arrow , which trails a fishing line , which gets over a branch in the tree , and then you asc@@ end up a rope which has been dragged into the tree by the line .
this reiter@@ ation is a huge flying but@@ tress that comes out the tree itself .
they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re finding out that red@@ woods can move moisture out of the air and down into their trun@@ ks , possibly all the way into their root systems .
what can the red@@ woods tell us about ourselves ?
richard preston , thank you very much , i think .
the pc virus problem is 25 years old now .
and you can see at the top of the screen , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a centi@@ pe@@ de scrolling across your computer when you get infected by this one .
well there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s multiple different ways , such as banking trojans , which will steal money from your online banking accounts when you do online banking , or key@@ log@@ gers .
they also use the global nature of internet to their advantage .
and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a back@@ door which will take over your computer .
now i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m not a lawyer , but if i would be , this is where i would say , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; i rest my case . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
so preparedness means that we can do stuff even when the things we take for granted aren &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t there .
there are lots of thing that the approach i take can predict , and there are some that it can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t .
and many of you may have noticed that doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t have as big an effect , as perhaps you would like it to have .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve increased it to 3.6 million .
you might notice what we don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t need to know : there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s no history in here .
and down at 100 they would build civilian nuclear energy , which is what they say is their objective .
everything is not predictable : the stock market is , at least for me , not predictable , but most complicated negotiations are predictable .
whether you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re an artist , a technologi@@ st , a lawyer or a fan , the handling of copyright directly impacts your life .
and then they benefit through the exposure , advertising and linked sales .
there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s musical labels .
if you saw these women on the street in their faded clothes , you might dismiss them as poor and simple .
sat@@ aw@@ al is one half-@@ mile long by one mile wide .
this is part of our collective narrative .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the most important map of all .
you don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t work in your self-@@ interest all the time , because when emotion comes into it , the wir@@ ing changes in the way it functions .
so , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve had an interesting laboratory to try to answer the question of the real question , which is what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the difference in somebody &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s life if you look at somebody like those people that you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve given everything to ? like all the resources they say they need . you gave them not a 100-@@ dollar computer ; you gave them the best computer . you gave them love ; you gave them joy . you were there to comfort them .
the defining factor is never resources ; it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s re@@ sour@@ ce@@ fulness .
honestly , better or worse ? say , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; a@@ ye . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
your model of the world is the filter . that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s shaping us .
how many of you here love surprises ? say , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; a@@ ye . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
if nothing else works for you , get a dog . don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t get a cat . get a dog , because if you leave for two minutes , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s like you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve been gone for six months when you show back up again five minutes later , right ?
now , 18 years later , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m proud to tell you , last year we fed two million people in 35 countries through our foundation , all during the holidays : thanksgiving , christmas -- -- in all the different countries around the world .
she said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s over . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; when i finished that night , she called him and left a message -- true story -- at the top of the world trade center where he worked , saying , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; honey , i love you , i just want you to know i want to marry you . it was stupid of me . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; she was asleep , because it was 3 a.m. for us , when he called her back from the top and said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; honey , i can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t tell you what this means . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and that was largely because there weren &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t any .
and we define ourselves by our gaps .
any dot can be clicked and expanded . and we see here , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; i would just feel so much better if i could cur@@ l up in his arms right now and feel his affection for me in the embrace of his body and the tender@@ ness of his lips . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
the next movement is called mo@@ bs .
here we see people that feel &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; slipping , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; nau@@ se@@ ous , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; responsible . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
this is in response to , what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s beautiful ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; miss world . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s called universe : revealing our modern myth@@ ology .
we can click on one of those and have the photograph be the center of the universe .
here we have our star field . here we have our shapes .
but i think they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re beautiful , don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t you ?
what would that mean ? i have no idea .
this looks like a series of breaking waves , and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s caused by shear@@ ing winds -- the wind above the cloud layer and below the cloud layer differ significantly , and in the middle , in between , you get this un@@ dul@@ ating of the air , and if the difference in those speeds is just right , the tops of the un@@ dul@@ ations cur@@ l over in these beautiful breaking wa@@ ve-@@ like vor@@ ti@@ ces .
the sharp , crisp outlines of this formation make it the best one for finding shapes in .
let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s go back a few years in time and see what happened back then .
using computers , even though they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re getting faster and better all the time , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a challenge to deal with gigab@@ y@@ tes of data , ter@@ aby@@ tes of data and extra@@ cting the relevant information .
you can see that there is &@@ #@@ 9@@ 1@@ ; a &@@ #@@ 93@@ ; scat@@ tering of x-@@ rays on the teeth , the metal in the teeth .
and again , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s fully interactive , so you can rot@@ ate and you can look at things in real time on these systems here .
it really just works like a huge iphone .
and to take that even further , this is a heart .
so mo@@ tts is doing something here , and probably he is going like this with his right hand , because the left side is activated on the motor corte@@ x .
i can peel off the layer of the lion .
and so it was simply astonishing to me to find an organization that actually appreciated both those sides .
he said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; ok . i measured the height of a brick .
the standard explanation is that the universe somehow sprang into existence , full of a strange kind of energy -- inflationary energy -- which blew it up .
the density of matter is fin@@ ite , and we have a chance of a consistent set of equ@@ ations that can describe the whole process .
and the next map now shows africa &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s gdp in 1960 , around the time of independence for many african states .
and to my astoni@@ shment , they backed me 100 percent .
everyone lives together in this hotel -- lectur@@ ers and students -- and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not surprising at all to find an impro@@ mp@@ tu tut@@ orial at 1 a.m .
i will be attending aims .
i want to point out a few other exceptional people in this picture .
and our partners across africa are extremely enthusiastic about this .
when computers were first introduced , they were said to be a million times faster than neurons .
and let me just sum@@ mari@@ ze . so the bottom line : the brain processes information using 100,000 times less energy than we do right now with this computer technology that we have .
now , what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s happening is that as transi@@ stors are getting smaller and smaller and smaller , they no longer behave like this .
ok , so a computer picks a specific item of data from memory , it sends it into the processor or the al@@ u , and then it puts the result back into memory .
this is kare@@ em &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s dark eyes and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the white background that you see here .
i was coming at it from a different perspective , where i was bringing that different perspective to bear on the problem .
so , despite the fact that i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to talk to you about an object that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s super@@ massive , and i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to get to what that really means in a moment , it has no fin@@ ite size .
i need to understand the mass of the object i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m claiming is a black hole , and what its schwarz@@ schild radius is .
so , at the center there , that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s actually where most of the star@@ light comes out from .
which is the job that i have to show you today .
you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re seeing an animation that goes between an example of what you would see if you don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t use this technique -- in other words , just a picture that shows the stars -- and the box is centered on the center of the galaxy , where we think the black hole is .
and because of that , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve been able to show that there is a super@@ massive black hole there .
in fact , we anticipated that star formation shouldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t proceed in that environment .
and i hope , if nothing else , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve convinced you that , one , we do in fact have a super@@ massive black hole at the center of the galaxy .
and how people get this music , how it comes into their lives , really fascin@@ ates me .
but the way we react to different combinations of these phen@@ omena is complex and emotional and not totally understood .
but every musician strikes a different balance between faith and reason , instinct and intelligence .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the time in which the big forms began to arise .
the culture in which we live now is a@@ wash with music of improvi@@ sation that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s been sliced , di@@ ced , layered and , god knows , distributed and sold .
and it exc@@ ites me now to meet people who are hi@@ kers , chefs , code writers , taxi drivers , people i never would have guessed who loved the music and who are passing it on .
the real key observation he made is that a free-@@ flying wing can sweep through more sky and generate more power in a unit of time than a fixed-@@ wing turbine .
if you give me a 7@@ 47 , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll make six mega@@ watts , which is more than the largest wind turbines today .
that comes from the last name of one of schumann &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s female friends .
and then you have to do the initial sketch of the character , which is like your structure of a piece , and then you add pen and pencil and whatever details that you need -- that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s poli@@ shing the drawing .
now , she chose c , g , b , a , e .
it felt like a revolution .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s based on hundreds of hours of research , of practice .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s by giving away what you think is your deepest secret that maybe millions of people are empowered to help improve it .
but what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s key here is , the reason these groups have been able to connect is because their work output is of the type that can be easily shared digitally -- a picture , a music file , software .
there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a problem with a traditional scientific paper .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s right here .
schools can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t be silos .
the same trash site is feeding more than 30 families .
now , to make this more concrete , let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s look at the list of top 10 words that statisti@@ cally stick out in the most favorite ted@@ talks and in the least favorite ted@@ talks .
and analysis shows if you want to be among the most favorite ted speakers , you should let your hair grow a little bit longer than average , make sure you wear your glasses and be slightly more dre@@ sse@@ d-up than the average ted speaker .
so i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to take as inspiration the fact that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re all interested in interacting with other people , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to completely strip it of all its compli@@ cating features , and i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to turn that object , that simpli@@ fied object , into a scientific probe , and provide the early stages , embry@@ onic stages of new insights into what happens in two brains while they simultaneously interact .
drugs of abuse would come in , and they would change the way you value the world . they change the way you value the symbols associated with your drug of choice , and they make you value that over everything else .
and the short answer is games .
can@@ aries used to be used as kind of bio@@ sensors in mines .

politics and politicians will only succeed if they actually try and treat with people as they are , rather than as they would like them to be .
right now , here we are linked up to long beach and everywhere else , and all these secret locations for a fraction of that cost , and we can send and receive huge quantities of information without it costing anything .
and you can see this looks a bit like a chef &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s hat , but actually that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s an assault , the one in blue .
obviously , here we have j@@ fk with that incredibly simple and powerful formul@@ ation , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; ask not what your country can do for you ; ask what you can do for your country , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; an incredibly noble sentiment .
how would i know who was the best ?
some teachers are far more effective than others .
you can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t really dispute what you see on the video , and there is a lot to be learned from that , and there are a lot of ways that we can grow as a profession when we actually get to see this .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s understandable , but our experience with met suggests that if teachers manage the process , if they collect video in their own classrooms , and they pick the lessons they want to submit , a lot of them will be eager to participate .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a movement that -- it advocates making bio@@ technology accessible to everyone , not just scientists and people in government labs .
then we like to take things apart .
let me show you what you could do right now .
if everyone in this room got involved , who knows what we could do ?
but you know what ?
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to hear from two people who are on the sharp end of the law .
because i am hiv positive .
now drug use or possession is illegal in almost every country .
we can also train judges so that they find flexi@@ bilities in the law and so that they rule on the side of tolerance rather than prejudice .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s where babies were born and people died .
the office building is basically obsol@@ ete for doing private work .
this is even a more interesting solution in seoul , korea .
we hope to have that built this fall .
we don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t really believe in cameras to do things in homes .
and they are thought to be able to filter a cubic kilometer of water every hour and can feed on 30 ki@@ los of zoo plan@@ k@@ ton a day to survive .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re often all frightened of sharks thanks to &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; ja@@ ws . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
it might be a change in the distribution of plan@@ k@@ ton .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll show you what they look like .
so very simple things like that , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re trying to learn about bas@@ king sharks .
but again , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s kind of surprising . you wouldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t really expect that .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s banned now , and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll be good news for the sharks .
and they sat on it for months actually .
you probably saw the hum@@ p@@ back whale footage that we got there a month or two ago off county wex@@ ford .
so thank you and thank you for listening .
they got themselves ready .
so with my hidden intention , i kept quiet .
but again , i can only affect society and affect government if i bring out the hard core evidence .
how did you end up in jail ? this was just a few weeks ago , i believe , yeah ?
does your breath smell bad while you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re answering my interrogation right now ?
i didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t want anyone to know that i was a girl , and they didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t .
i was just allowed to be me , growing and changing in every moment .
life magazine introduced generations of people to distant , far-@@ off cultures they never knew existed through pictures .
this is my contribution to the civil rights fight of my generation .
once they got over the shock , though , by and large people opted for somewhere between 70 to 95 percent or the 3 to 20 percent marks .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s too late .
apparently , luci@@ fer means &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; the light . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
all of them come from the cameras of american soldiers .
we look at what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s inside of the person , the bad apples .
this is stanley mil@@ gram , little jewish kid from the bronx , and he asked the question , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; could the holocaust happen here , now ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re a good person . you complain .
most of the time , we are in institutions , so the stanford prison study is a study of the power of institutions to influence individual behavior .
they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to become numbers .
mind@@ lessly taking the first small step .
bullying is a disease . prejudice is a disease . violence is a disease .
she came down , saw that mad@@ house and said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; you know what , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s terrible what you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re doing to those boys .
wesley and the guy -- 20 and a half inches height .
we would have no access to love or to the ability to create .
and of course consider images that can be sensory patterns , visual , such as you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re having right now in relation to the stage and me , or audi@@ tory images , as you are having now in relation to my words .
very odd -- i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve analyzed this for a while .
and i thought about a solution to this problem .
you have , in effect , lost consciousness when you have damage to that red section of the brain stem .
except that they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re not as rich as ours , because they don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t have a cerebral corte@@ x like we do .
we should look at how society and culture in this socio-@@ cultural regulation are a work in progress .
my dad actually resigned from the male-@@ only business club in my hometown because he said he would never be part of an organization that would one day welcome his son , but not his daughter .
i say , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; online organizing . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
xen@@ opho@@ bia &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s on the rise . the trafficking of women and girls .
many of them are working in deeply intra@@ ctable systems -- the military , congress , the education system , etc .
the maxim , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; know thy@@ self &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; has been around since the ancient gree@@ ks .
this is the term that ar@@ mies use when they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve lost a battle .
i may also be interested in knowing how focused i am , so i can put my level of attention into the circuit board on the other side .
we created the responsive room where the lights music and blin@@ ds adjusted to your state .
normally we think about technology as interactive .
with human@@ ized technology we can monitor the quality of your sleep cycles .
ariel garten : know thy@@ self , with a brain scanner
so let me just tell you , the great part of all of this ?
and with the same dogged determination that my father had bred into me since i was such a child -- he taught me how to sail , knowing i could never see where i was going , i could never see the shore , and i couldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t see the sa@@ ils , and i couldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t see the destination .
and you all know what it is . you don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t need to have a disability to know that .
and he said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; do you love it ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and i didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t know what to do .
nobody &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s ever done it before , so i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to go do it .
and i set up kan@@ chi , because my organization was always going to be named after my elephant , because disability is like the elephant in the room .
and stop with the labels , the limiting .
the reason , i think , is that the pensioners believe they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve chosen to be pensioners , whereas the young unemployed feel it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s been thrust upon them .
do you call it the bailout of greece or the bailout of a load of stupid banks which lent to greece ?
and i think that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s probably right .
everybody else at the time of google , more or less , was trying to be a portal .
if you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re on the way to visit your mother in-law , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d probably prefer to stay on the left .
there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the real value , which is when you make something in a factory and provide a service , and then there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a kind of dubious value , which you create by changing the way people look at things .
i would argue , in britain there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a much better frame of reference , which is to tell people that more first-class mail arrives the next day in the u.k. than in germany .
and within that context , we can offer the kids time -- something that seems in short supply in their over-@@ scheduled lives .
hi . so , this chap here , he thinks he can tell you the future .
these drugs were brought to market . they were prescribed very widely because heart attacks are a very common thing , and it took so long for us to find out that these drugs also caused an increased rate of death that before we detected that safety signal , over 100,000 people died un@@ necessarily in america from the prescription of anti-@@ arr@@ hy@@ th@@ mic drugs .
only three of the negative trials were published , but all but one of the positive trials were published .
and the most staggering thing of all of this , to me , is that not only is this a problem , not only do we recognize that this is a problem , but we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve had to suffer fake fixes .
nasa supported this work 12 years ago as part of the rebuilding of the hayden planet@@ arium so that we would share this with the world .
we have a growing user base of this , and we network dom@@ es .
so , with the mit media lab , for quite a while now , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve been engaged in a field called active music .
so we know , for instance , that music is almost always the last thing that people with advanced alzheimer &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s can still respond to .
the main singer disappe@@ ars at the beginning of the opera and the entire stage becomes the main character . it becomes his legacy .
so , first of all , dan , do you want to say hi to everyone and tell everyone who you are ?
do they provide structure for us to do that ? and , you know , that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a personal relationship to expression that is lacking in the technological sphere . so , you know , with dan , we needed a new design process , a new engineering process to sort of discover his movement and his path to expression that allow him to perform .
do you remember the story of ody@@ sse@@ us and the sirens from high school or junior high school ?
if you do that tomorrow , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll be dead , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll be dead , every single one of the men will be dead .
it has these strong , heroic arms that can lift dough@@ nuts into your mouth .
on average , it was just a completely pointless exchange of money that i would regret .
we look at the savings rate and it has been declining since the 1950s .
yes , this person retired at 150 percent of their working income in retirement .
and from the future self &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s point of view , everything is in reverse .
and just for kicks we ran his picture through the bal@@ ding , aging and weight gain software to see how he would look .
also , those very sounds tend not to be represented by the characters that are available in european languages .
even in the best-@@ re@@ sourced countries in the world , this life expectancy gap is as much as 20 years .
in zimbabwe , for example , there were just about a dozen psychiatri@@ sts , most of whom lived and worked in har@@ are city , leaving only a couple to address the mental health care needs of nine million people living in the countryside .
for me , what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s truly sun@@ dar about the idea of task shifting , though , isn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t that it simply makes health care more accessible and affordable but that it is also fundamentally empowering .
we began the project with an interim report , which quickly pulled together a lot of information that had been collected on the subject by many , many researchers .
but when did a bee actually ever give you an in@@ voice ?
now i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to show you how business as usual will affect this .
if you drill water to make coke near a village farm , that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not illegal , but yes , it costs the community .
and the chinese government responded sensi@@ bly and placed a ban on f@@ elling .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s about energy emissions .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve actually kind of made an ethical choice in society to not have coral reefs .
but the man had somehow a lot of room at the bottom .
fe@@ yn@@ man loved this story .
but it was really brutal .
we were up in the mountains , 1976 .
but he was very excited that he had finally met somebody who had the same experience with my father as he had with his father .
he would try to visu@@ alize it , guided by a small number of simple principles .
if you could do all of them , you would have a very precise theory .
how should we really honor fe@@ yn@@ man ?
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a compound curve interior .
so the problem became -- and they set this dilemma to me -- that you have to design the interior using only our existing technology , and there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s no money for tool@@ ing or mol@@ ding .
and despite all of our best efforts and intentions , kids are always going to figure out how to do the most dangerous thing they can , in whatever environment they can .
i first saw this in a canadian film board film when i was 10 , and it left a lasting impression , to see babies playing with knives .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a very simple exercise -- buy a song on it@@ unes , write it to a cd , then rip the cd to an mp@@ 3 and play it on your very same computer .
so this motivated me to become an orthop@@ edi@@ c surgeon and to see if i couldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t focus on solutions for those problems that would keep me playing sports and not limit me .
well the reason is because there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not enough donor cycles .
so that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s our biologi@@ c approach right now .
and it wouldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t be fun to talk about the space age without seeing a flag that was carried to the moon and back , on apollo 11 .
more tomorrow . i also have pictures coming of the library for those of you that have asked for pictures .
so hopefully tomorrow i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll show one or two more objects from the stage , but for today i just wanted to say thank you for all the people that came and talked to us about it .
but i brought along here a lump of coal -- right here , one lump of coal .
when edi@@ son invented the light bulb , pretty much looked like this .
but they want to use it -- seriously .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re also working on noise canceling things like snor@@ ing , noise from automobil@@ es .
i said we can shor@@ ten the column , we can spread it out to cover the couch .
i have a bunch of other in@@ ven@@ tions .
getting it over there ?
so i exist somewhat outside of the mainstream of design thinking .
to this end , i have worked in sugar for stefan sag@@ meister , three-time ted speaker .
for some reason , i thought it would be a good idea to put an inter@@ mission in my talk .
&@@ quo@@ t@@ ; you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve never really been sure of this , but i can assure you that this quir@@ k you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re so self-@@ conscious of is intensely ende@@ aring .
and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s very , very common for designers and people in the visual arts to feel that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re not contributing enough , or worse , that all we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re doing is contributing to landfill .
re@@ zero keeps his balance by constantly measuring his pitch angle with a sensor .
with a screen it could inform people or show them around in a fun and entertaining way .
and so , going back to this ab@@ alone shell , besides being nan@@ o-@@ structured , one thing that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s fascinating , is when a male and a female ab@@ alone get together , they pass on the genetic information that says , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; this is how to build an exquisite material .
the ab@@ alone shell here -- and if you fracture it , you can look at the fact that it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s nan@@ o-@@ structured .
it took them about 50 million years to learn how to perfect how to make that ab@@ alone shell .
i brought it here .
angela bel@@ cher : using nature to grow batteries
and then you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll hear things like the train , a plane , a car -- so , the commute .
and what you find is that , especially with creative people -- designers , program@@ mers , writers , engineers , thin@@ kers -- that people really need long stretches of un@@ interrupted time to get something done .
why do we expect people to work well if they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re being interrupted all day at the office ?
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s kind of ridiculous . it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a total de@@ coy .
i mean , what are the chances that all 10 people are ready to stop ?
because the offices are well equipped , everything should be there for them to do their work , but they don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t want to go there right now , so how do we change that ?
you can quit i.@@ m. ; you can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t hide your manager .
this is my office . it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s out there .
i mean , i couldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t take your phones off you if i wanted to .
i think , quite a nice feature .
so , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve been conducting a lot of research .
it brings ru@@ di@@ mentary banking services to places where there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s no banking infrastructure .
like , this is vi@@ ag@@ ra that i bought from a back@@ street sex shop in china .
for me , this kind of person@@ i@@ fies this connected world , where everything is intertw@@ ined , and the dots are -- it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s all about the dots joining together .
and , with that , comes the third point , which is obligation -- and an obligation to that availability .
our reality right now is less interesting than the story we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to tell about it later .
what were we just talking about ?
dean or@@ nish shares new research that shows how adopting healthy lifestyle habits can affect a person at a genetic level . for instance , he says , when you live healthier , eat better , exercise , and love more , your brain cells actually increase .
this idea is nicely captured by this quote : &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; things without all remedy should be without regard ; what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s done is done . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
these are the classic conditions that create regret .
but it turns out that regret feels awful in four very specific and consistent ways .
make it go away . make it go away . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
because of course , sometimes we do make decisions that have irre@@ vo@@ cable and terrible consequences , either for our own or for other people &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s health and happiness and livelihoods , and in the very worst case scenario , even their lives .
when other people see my tattoo , for the most part they like how it looks .
thank you .
half of them gave over the internet .
and pretty soon , the average price was 192 dollars .
today these low prices are available in the 25 countries where we work , and in a total of 62 countries , and about 5@@ 50,000 people are getting the benefits of them .
recently we did an evaluation of the first 18 months of our efforts in rwanda .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s about 43 percent of all the pregnancies .
i am grateful for this prize , and i will use it to that end .
the classrooms have no walls .
but an amazing alternative energy company in paris is taking us off the grid with solar .
this was a great thing .
this young man is picking organic vegetables .
and together these volunteers and the teachers are deeply committed to creating a new generation of global , green leaders .
is this do@@ able in your community ?
cha@@ z ebert : it was cha@@ z who stood by my side through three attempts to re@@ construct my jaw and restore my ability to speak .
then i tried typing words on my laptop and using its built in voice .
they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d never made one from previ@@ ous@@ ly-@@ recorded materials .
people who need a voice should know that most computers already come with built-in speaking systems .
the initi@@ als stood for program@@ med logic for automated teaching operations .
now we live in the age of the internet , which seems to be creating a form of global consciousness .
sometimes they assume i am deaf .
a guy goes into a psychiatrist .
so what can we do ?
other examples you can see here are from latvia , lithuania , estonia -- the central european countries .
so first you ask a big question : why we do it ? what is the goal ?
you will recall that in 1976 , june 16 , the students of south africa boyco@@ tted the language of afri@@ ka@@ ans as the medium of the op@@ press@@ or , as they were sort of like really told that they must do everything in afri@@ ka@@ ans -- biology , mathematics -- and what about our languages ?
she ended up underneath the car .
and i ended up with a plastic nose , por@@ cel@@ ain teeth and all kinds of other things .
so they eventually started matching their talents and skills to all of my needs .
so i moved on from there .
and as a blind person , your visual memory fa@@ des and is replaced with how you feel about things and how things sound and how things smell .
and he wrote to the academi@@ cians in paris , trying to explain his theory .
and i think gali@@ leo summed up , very nicely , the power of mathematics to understand the scientific world around us .
but i wanted to try and en@@ rich him .
so i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to take you through , perhaps push you a little bit mathemati@@ cally -- so brace your@@ selves -- push you a little bit to understand how this language works , which enables us to capture what is sym@@ me@@ try .
so both of these objects have six sym@@ me@@ tries .
let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s do a rotation by a third of a turn anti@@ clo@@ ck@@ wise , and reflect in the line through x .
but the shapes match up if i rot@@ ate by a sixth of a turn around the point where all the tri@@ angles meet .
well , unfortunately it isn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t really a picture . if i could have my board at the side here , great , excellent .
two ? so you should have sat down earlier .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve learned that they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re really the essence of what makes for progress , even when they seem to be terrible .
but i think from the point of view of a neander@@ thal , there would have been a lot of disappro@@ val of the wi@@ mp@@ ish chop@@ pers that we now have .
and mark t@@ wain , who knew all about ty@@ pe@@ setting , really was smit@@ ten by this machine .
and my favorite example of that occurred beginning in 1976 , when it was discovered that the bacteria causing legion@@ nai@@ res disease had always been present in natural waters , but it was the precise temperature of the water in heating , venti@@ lating and air conditioning systems that raised the right temperature for the maximum re@@ production of legion@@ ella bac@@ illu@@ s .
think of the financial world , for example .
for some reason , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s no standard syl@@ lab@@ us , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s no basic course .
here &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s something that drives me crazy .
you get it every time .
and instead of that point and click , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s like a push and pull , things colli@@ de as you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d expect them . just like on my real desk , i can -- let me just grab these guys -- i can turn things into piles instead of just the fol@@ ders that we have .
i think you can really en@@ rich the way we brow@@ se our photographs and bring it to that kind of sho@@ e@@ box of , you know , photos with your family on the kitchen table kind of thing .
let me introduce you to my brand new project , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; baro@@ que in rock , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; which became a golden disc most recently .
they acquire the sensi@@ bility of truth because they repeat over and over again , and they o@@ ssi@@ fy and calci@@ fy , and they become real .
and i said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the black box for wall street ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and the gag is that , of course , these aren &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t just running through the market .
and the thing is , is that this isn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t google .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re designing for this machine diale@@ ct .
it involves light con@@ es and quantum ent@@ ang@@ lement , and i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t really understand any of that .
this much , right ?
js : cuts itself .
fifty percent of crashes happen at inter@@ sections .
add that together with the gas , and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s $ 1@@ 12,000 per year , just for that sign in each direction .
when people come to an unfamiliar situation they don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t know how to deal with they slow down .
for example , measles was four million of the deaths back as recently as 1990 and now is under 400,000 .
and more recently you can see it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s just around the equ@@ ator .
and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s where we saw the malaria map shrinking .
i can say that , even though i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m a college drop-@@ out .
so , how do you make education better ?
you might think these are people with master &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s degrees .
and the whole spirit and attitude in those schools is very different than in the normal public schools .
and that allows us to understand who &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s doing it well , and call them out , and find out what those techniques are .
you know , the system doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t naturally make it happen .
the first embrace is something that we think , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; oh , this is very easy , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; but it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s actually getting harder , and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s paying attention to the world around us .
i was to the point where i was using a stop@@ watch and painting squares out of random@@ ness , and i wasn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t getting anywhere . so i went back and dumped all my paintings in the arno , and i thought , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to just start playing around .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll find a way to get in , because i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t want to see this history disappear . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
how many of you are completely comfortable with calling your@@ selves a leader ?
&@@ quo@@ t@@ ; and i felt so bad for this dude that i took the lol@@ li@@ pop , and as soon as i did , you got this incredibly severe look on your face and you looked at my mom and my dad , and you said , &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; look at that . look at that .
we need to get over it so we can move beyond it , and our little brothers and our little sisters , and one day our kids -- or our kids right now -- can watch and start to value the impact we can have on each other &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s lives more than money and power and titles and influence .
so nowadays in the operating room , we no longer need to use sunlight .
so if you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve sent three specim@@ ens , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s an hour later .
the molecule passes through and gets ex@@ cre@@ ted .
and then if that no@@ de has cancer , the woman would go on to get the ax@@ ill@@ ary ly@@ mph no@@ de dis@@ section .
in the setting of prostate cancer , up to 60 percent of men after prostate cancer surgery may have ur@@ inary in@@ contin@@ ence and ere@@ cti@@ le dis@@ function .
so here &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a tumor .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d like to leave you with this final thought .
and this cell is one of the thousands of kinds of cell that we are learning about .
but electricity also will go in all directions -- the path of least resistance , which is where that phrase , in part , comes from .
and because it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a protein , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s en@@ coded for in the dna of this organis@@ m .
so if we could figure out what cells they are , we could maybe find new targets for which drugs could be designed or screened against , or maybe places where electro@@ des could be put in for people who have very severe disability .
and the animal &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s going to hear a tone -- and a flash of light occurred there .
maybe 100,000 people have coch@@ le@@ ar im@@ plants , which allow them to hear .
and the goal , of course , of this ma@@ ze is to get out of the water and go to a little platform that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s under the lit top port .
and by turning things off , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s more or less a zero .
and we also sam@@ pled the outdoor air .
thank you .
there were no cars , so it seemed even better , in some ways .
so it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s been a very optimistic time , i think , and i want to just talk about a few of those things .
this is what they think about my site ; it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s ranked by blog authority .
so basically , the number of pages that mention this term , that also mention this page , the percentage of those pages is that person &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s google share of that term .
they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re talking about slavery in 1860 .
if you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re the second site there , most people link to you .
we are increasingly offered a diet in which sensation , not story , is king .
and the speed with which they associate it with &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; slu@@ m@@ dog millionaire &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; or the fa@@ vel@@ as in rio speaks to the enduring nature .
and the stories they held provided a shared experience .
these films held what was too hurtful to say out loud , and they became more useful to me than the whi@@ sp@@ ers of survivors and the occasional glimpse of a tattoo on a maiden aunt &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s wrist .
can opera be ever-@@ so-@@ slightly sexy ? the glorious sopran@@ o danielle de nie@@ se shows how , singing the flir@@ ty &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; meine lippen , sie k@@ ü@@ ssen so hei@@ ss . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; which , translated , means , as you might guess : &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; i kiss so hot . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; from giu@@ di@@ tta by fran@@ s leh@@ á@@ r ; accompan@@ ist : ingrid sur@@ gen@@ or .
commerce , on the other hand , is relatively quick , essentially creative , highly effective and efficient , and fundamentally honest , because we can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t exchange value for very long if we don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t trust each other .
so we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve designed products and we analyzed chemicals down to the parts per million .
the upper is n@@ ylon 6 that can go back to ca@@ pro@@ lac@@ tam , the bottom , a poly@@ ole@@ phine -- infin@@ itely recycl@@ able thermo@@ plastic .
when asked , they said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s kind of like a giant toilet that doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t flush . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and we have plenty of energy , so we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll solve that problem , but the biology problem &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s tricky , because as we put through all these toxic materials that we dis@@ gor@@ ge , we will never be able to recover that .
shoes for nike , where the up@@ pers are polye@@ sters , infin@@ itely recycl@@ able , the bottoms are bio@@ degra@@ dable sol@@ es .
because if they toxi@@ fy themselves , being the lo@@ west-@@ cost producer , send it to the lo@@ west-@@ cost distribution -- wal@@ -@@ mart -- and then we send them all our money , what we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll discover is that we have what , effectively , when i was a student , was called mutually assured destruction .
and then the compost is all taken back to the roofs of the city , where we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got farming , because what we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve done is lifted up the city , the landscape , into the air to -- to restore the native landscape on the roofs of the buildings .
this is five times larger .
we didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t know about x@@ key@@ score . we didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t know about cyber@@ trans .
yet we have these files .
all right , how many swedish deci@@ sion@@ makers and politicians and business leaders use , every day , u.s.@@ -based services , like , you know , run windows or os@@ x , or use facebook or linkedin , or store their data in clouds like i@@ cloud or sky@@ drive or drop@@ box , or maybe use online services like amazon web services or sales support ?
and whoever tells you that they have nothing to hide simply hasn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t thought about this long enough .
she was one of the targets of n@@ sa surveillance .
humans have long held a fascination for the human brain .
and what you can see is it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s very non-@@ uniform . you see a lot more structure there .
we get one from mom , one from dad .
and in seattle , we take these -- this is a whole human hemisphere -- and we put them into what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s basically a glori@@ fied meat sli@@ cer .
you can see on the micro@@ scope slide here , that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s happening in real time .
green is the sort of cool areas where it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not turned on .
so if you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re in drug discovery , for example , you can go through an entire listing of what the genome has on offer to find perhaps better drug targets and optimi@@ ze .
these aren &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t schizophren@@ ic individuals , but they do show some population variation .
so why is that ?
the thing is , if we don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t know whether we are doing any good , we are not any better than the medieval doctors and their lee@@ ches .
&@@ quo@@ t@@ ; if you give the nets for free , people are not going to value them .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s bad , but there are places like that .
and then you make it easy and give a reason to act now by adding a kilo of l@@ enti@@ ls for each immuni@@ zation .
the third one is important because if we think people get used to hand@@ outs , it might destroy markets to distribute free bed nets .
you know how to immuni@@ ze kids , you know how to give bed nets . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
tell people the benefits of education , that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s very cheap to do .
but look what we just did today .
and now , maybe , we can go back to the bigger question that i started with at the beginning .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve all heard these things .
and that has to do with me because in 1994 , i packed a few things into a backpack and headed off for a year of travel in the middle of my university career .
so let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s start shedding light on this amazing eclectic continent that has so much to offer .
so the very definition -- to say &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; invest in africa &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; is a no-@@ go .
but looking at goldman sachs &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; work -- we had the famous bri@@ c report .
the announcement just came out the last few weeks .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s more expensive to transport goods . prices of goods go up , inflation is affected .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the 24-hour rolling african news channel .
it also provides a third of the food we eat .
we so rarely look at the sky .
so this is the footage that i was showing everybody .
okay .
so this is the footage he photographed , and it was pretty moving and pretty awe@@ -@@ inspiring .
it was , inci@@ dentally , the last time i ever saw daylight .
and he said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; because no one knows you had anything to do with it . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
how could somebody read using their finger@@ tips ?
kt : no .
kb : just don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t break my concentration .
i need two people to help me out real quick .
ok , now , do you believe in wit@@ ch@@ craft at all ?
kb : what did you feel ?
ok , now , allow it to stay there .
and hold it there , hold it there , both of you , hold it there .
come right over here , next to me .
and i want you to release that negative energy by shaking it from side to side .
you knew !
they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll keep an eye on me to make sure i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t do anything funny .
s@@ j : you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re over a cup .
do you think the spike is under your left hand , or under your right hand ?
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not good . hi . yeah . real bad . don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t even look at me .
you know that when you have those abusive voices , all those little neurons get together and in that little gap you get a real toxic &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; i want to kill myself &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; kind of chemical , and if you have that over and over again on a loop tape , you might have yourself depression .
we are not equipped for the 21st century .
we need to know why people are doing what they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re doing .
but it was test@@ ably stupid .
and in that pair , one person gets a message saying , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; do you want to give up some of your $ 10 you earned for being here and ship it to someone else in the lab ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
so to make the experiment , i knew i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d have to go into the brain and manipulate oxy@@ to@@ cin directly .
so if i do something that hurts you , i feel that pain .
tell that guy to wait half an hour .
now there are other ways the system can be inhi@@ b@@ ited .
the bride .
so there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s tons of ways that we can connect to other people , and it seems to be universal .
i tried to look at where did the kind of learning we do in schools , where did it come from ?
and you have people who guide those computers to do their cl@@ eri@@ cal jobs .
one of your students must have been passing by , showed them how to use the mouse . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s one community of children in southern india whose english pron@@ unci@@ ation is really bad , and they needed good pron@@ unci@@ ation because that would improve their jobs .
i came back after two months and the children tro@@ oped in and said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve understood nothing . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
kal@@ li@@ kupp@@ am had caught up with my control school in new delhi , a rich private school with a trained bio@@ technology teacher .
the repti@@ lian part of our brain , which sits in the center of our brain , when it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s threatened , it sh@@ uts down everything else , it sh@@ uts down the pre@@ frontal corte@@ x , the parts which learn , it sh@@ uts all of that down .
you can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t catch me .
you already heard about that . you know what that means .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a facility which is practically un@@ manned .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll play at these rock shows , be on stage standing completely still , and they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re like , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s she doing ? ! what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s she doing ? ! &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
if i pass out on the next song ...
this quan@@ dary led to the title of the project , which considers in many ways that we are all the living dead and that we in some ways represent ghosts of the past and the future .
and i found these maps which you see here .
so they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re testing its viru@@ l@@ ence .
everyone showed up .
tensions between these two families date back to 19@@ 13 when there was a dispute over local political power .
this is just an abri@@ dged rendering of over a thousand images .
there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s nothing too difficult about the piece .
and you feel really quite -- believe it or not -- detached from the instrument and from the stick , even though i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m actually holding the stick quite tightly .
they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re all different .
exactly . because i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m not even touching it .
in a year &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s time , it could be two extra steps .
however , not one of you got out of your seats to think , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; right ! how can i cla@@ p ? ok , maybe ...
and interestingly , the older i became , and when i became a full-time student at a so called &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; music institution , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; all of that went out of the window .
in this soaring demonstration , deaf percu@@ ssi@@ onist evelyn glen@@ nie illustrates how listening to music involves much more than simply letting sound waves hit your ear@@ drums .
and it got big enough to the point where there was a float last year at the macy &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s thanksgiving day parade , and rick ast@@ ley pops out , and rick@@ rolls millions of people on television .
but that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s interesting about this .
got a couple questions for you .
but there were some good things that came out of that too .
and they were probably pleased to see you on top of the time poll .
dinosaur evolution proceeded at a stat@@ ely pace , an order of magnitude slower on any way you want to measure it .
a three-@@ and-a-half foot thing , beautiful skull , predator , me@@ at-@@ e@@ ater , a two-@@ legged animal .
your job as a leader -- this is definitely a team sport -- your job as a leader is to try to inspire them to do more work than they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve ever done in their life under conditions that they can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t imagine .
it turns out to have a fore@@ brain one-@@ fif@@ teenth the size of a human .
somebody get the front legs .
and then work later is going to take us to tibet .
now we have diver@@ gence over time , but we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve created the third dimension of area .
they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re really kin@@ dre@@ d discip@@ lines .
you have to have those steps . if you have -- it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s easy to get kids interested in science .
you give her a quick crack in the teeth with your elbow and blaze for the finish line .
they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re not doing 26 miles ; they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re doing 100 , 150 miles at a time , and apparently without injury , without problems .
there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not a fast woman on the planet and there never has been .
so about seven years , eight years to reach your peak , and then gradually you fall off your peak , until you go back to the starting point .
you need a pack to pull together .
and what happened was we started creating these fancy cushi@@ oned things , which can make running &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; better , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; called running shoes .
but maybe there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s another benefit there as well .
for me , that was the white space ; that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what robots could not do yet .
he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a scary monster .
you call your friend , she puts her handset in a robot , and , b@@ am ! you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re a me@@ bot -- you can make eye contact , you can talk with your friends , you can move around , you can gesture -- maybe the next best thing to really being there , or is it ?
i imagine a time not too far from now -- my mom can go to her computer , open up a browser and jack into a little robot .
to explore that question , we did a study in the boston area where we put one of three interventions in people &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s homes for a period of several weeks .
but we can push this idea further .
robots touch something deeply human within us .
and i can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t have my po@@ sse laugh@@ in &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; at me .
and i followed this guy everywhere until i had him in the room , and i read him one of my pieces , and you know what he told me ?
i can master shock of &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; the crying game &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; with the awe of a child being called an aids victim by a bully who didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t know that it was his father who gave it to my mother , and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a double enten@@ dre .
i then went on wondering whether i could actually replace her image , so i got a loo@@ k-@@ alike of diana and posed her in the right positions and angles and created something that was in , or existed in , the public imagination .
well , here is the image .
so , all this work is getting shown in art galleries .
this image is quite interesting , actually , because i think we made it three years ago .
what jack nicholson might be up to in his celebrity life , and the fact that he tried to ... he had a bit of road rage and golf-@@ clu@@ bbed a driver the other day .
has anyone here wondered what will happen if you go back to your room at night , and you start getting chest pains , short@@ ness of breath , sweating ?
that is something to keep in mind . we can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t deal with it with situations like this .
we have 25 positions right now -- all of them trained , board certified in the usa , canada or britain .
and we will do other centers .
they need to be alive , they need to feed .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re also starting an@@ c@@ ill@@ ary health-@@ care technology training programs -- training people in echo@@ car@@ dio@@ graphy , cardiac ultrasound , those kinds of things . now , with that kind of training , it gives people motivation .
and i actually feel at home here , because there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a lot of autism genetics here .
my drawings got to star in the movie too .
and the way i sold livestock jobs is i showed off my drawings , i showed off pictures of things .
i was really concerned about having to wear this gad@@ get on my face .
i find a lot of people have difficulty doing that .
he was now dr. car@@ lock in the movie .
and when i was 13 , i had a job at a dress@@ maker &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s shop sewing clothes .
because what i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m observing is the good teachers , for a lot of these kids , are out in the community colleges , but we need to be getting some of these good teachers into the high schools .
what are you most passionate about ?
now my own speci@@ ality is combining digital technology and magic .
b@@ ye-@@ bye .
and it was deep . it was deep in my soul .
now there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a talent un@@ to itself .
and now the shore is coming , and there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s just a little part of me that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s sad .
thank you .
the first problem is there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s inadequate disaster response .
they send him to iraq .
i think it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s very important , because right now somebody needs to step up , and this generation of veterans has the opportunity to do that if they are given the chance .
what would this lead to ?
and so they invented the scientific journal as a way of syn@@ chroni@@ zing the argument across the community of natural scientists .
the program@@ mers come and go .
this has the following effect : a program@@ mer in edinburgh and a program@@ mer in ente@@ b@@ be can both get the same -- a copy of the same piece of software .
right .
it was the expectation of the citizens that she would not be censored .
this one i thought i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d show you .
morgan hen@@ dry : be@@ ware of safety is an instrumental rock band .
so we literally are all made out of star@@ dust .
and if you look at the top left , you see a little teen@@ y dark dot .
okay , we have parach@@ ute aligned .
bc : we enter the mar@@ tian atmosphere .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s when we separate from the back shell , and we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re now in free-@@ fall .
then we get a little bit more serious , so we have what we call our c@@ ad / cam@@ s and all the engineers who are involved , or scientists who are involved , who know about thermal properties , know about design , know about atmospheric interaction , parach@@ utes , all of these things , which they work in a team effort and actually design a spacecraft in a computer to some extent , so to see , does that meet the requirement that we need .
but also , if there is something that we cannot reach because it is too high on a cliff , we have a little laser system which will actually z@@ ap the rock , evapor@@ ate some of it , and actually analyze what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s coming from that rock .
so as we flew by away from it , we looked back . and guess what ?
you just drive to the nearest lake , stick your hose in it , and you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got your car filled up .
so if we start to think expon@@ entially , we can see how this is starting to affect all the technologies around us .
we have the ability to do more powerful things with them .
and of course , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s an app for that .
you can tweet your weight to your friends , and they can keep you in line .
how about aug@@ menting the physician ?
so a few examples : we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re now in the era of &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; fantastic voyage , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; the ip@@ ill .
in gen@@ omics now , the genome cost about a billion dollars about 10 years ago when the first one came out .
we can be prevent@@ ative ; that prevention can be personalized ; and more importantly , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s going to become increasingly partici@@ pat@@ ory .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve been actually using adult stem cells now in clinical trials for about 15 years to approach a whole range of topics , particularly in cardiovascular disease .
the first one is dedicated to spencer , and his grandmother , who was shocked by his work .
in those days there was still countryside close to the city , farms , corn@@ fields , cows ; even not far from our building with its blur@@ red brick and long shad@@ ow@@ y hallway you could find tra@@ cts with hills and trees you could pretend were mountains and forests .
the girl , my old love , the last lost time i saw her when she came to find me at a party , her drun@@ kenly stumbling , falling , sprawling , skirt hiked , eyes v@@ ein@@ ed red , swollen with tears , her shame , her dishon@@ or .
this is called &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; thir@@ st . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
a casual impulse , a fancy , never thought of until now , hardly thought of even now ...
the girls , to my horror , aver@@ ted their gaze .
c.@@ k. williams : poetry of youth and age
samuel pi@@ sar , an auschwitz survivor , said , and i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll quote him , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; the holocaust teaches us that nature , even in its cru@@ ele@@ st moments , is ben@@ ign in comparison with man , when he loses his moral compass and his reason . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
but images don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t need to be graphic in order to remind us of the tragedy of war .
what we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to try and do today , in the 16 and a bit minutes i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got left , is to try and answer three questions . the first one is , why ?
that was our h@@ f radio anten@@ na .
two norwe@@ gi@@ ans did it as a team in 2000 . no one &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s done it solo .
when the ice was flat or flat@@ tish , i could just about pull both .
some pretty radical technology , a radical approach --@@ but it worked perfectly .
i took a photo of that . sat down on my sle@@ dge . did a sort of video diary piece .
i thought , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll have to do .
this is probably why i didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t get into trouble about the length of my air@@ strip .
since then , no one has ever ski@@ ed -- this was 93 years ago -- since then , no one has ever ski@@ ed from the coast of antarctica to the pole and back .
but i was still concerned , so i said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; you know what , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m not going to do it . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and i remembered that the old and drunken guy came one day to the lab wanting to make some easy cash and this was the guy .
i do want to leave you with one positive thought .
but what if we looked at fear in a fresh way ?
these were the fears that danced in the imagin@@ ations of these poor men , and as it turned out , the fear they chose to listen to would govern whether they lived or died .
what would happen to our minds ?
the novelist vladimir n@@ abo@@ kov said that the best reader has a combination of two very different temper@@ am@@ ents , the artistic and the scientific .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m 43 years old right now .
therefore , they asked their parents to go down to the streets and collect them , bring them back home .
and while this was the major difference between many initiatives before to create change , before we thought , and governments told us -- and even sometimes it was true -- that change was imposed on us , and people rejected that , because they thought that it is alien to their culture .
i remember one night when someone phoned me on my cellphone -- ordinary person who i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t know -- from tah@@ ri@@ r square .
is this a stor@@ y-@@ of-the-@@ year , a stor@@ y-@@ of-the-@@ decade or something more ?
they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve had some speakers there .
and frankie says , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m number 22 in line , and i can see the needle coming down towards me , and there is blood all over the place .
you don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t want to share a needle anymore than you want to share a tooth@@ brush even with someone you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re sleeping with .
so what we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve been doing in the united states is reviewing the data -- endlessly reviewing the data .
they are gay men on the party scene who have , on average , three times more partners than straight people on the party scene .
but it is changing the equation of what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s rational in sexual decision-making .
what does that mean ?
there are as many different ways of being rational as there are human beings on the planet , and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s one of the g@@ lor@@ ies of human existence .
and i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d pull her out on the front porch .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s called cla@@ w-@@ hammer style , that he had learned from his mother and grandmother .
it sounds something like this .
we were standing on the edge of thousands of acres of cotton .
now , my mother hoped that we learned from that the value of hard work .
good news : chari@@ ot &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s coming .
but then , when i thought about it beyond that , it was very simple things .
and we moved across the street from michael and john whitney .
they said they were going to beat us up if we didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t make some gun@@ powder for them .
so let me put them all together . and also , i can change the sounds by stepping on this pedal right here , and -- let me just close out here by doing you a little ham@@ bone solo or something like this .
not only is there a relationship between the ethics of science and the ethics of being a citizen in democracy , but there has been , historically , a relationship between how people think about space and time , and what the cosmos is , and how people think about the society that they live in .
and mer@@ ging them together to make the final quantum theory of space and time and gravity , is the culmination of that , something that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s going on right now .
now , darwin taught us that there are processes of self-@@ organization that suffi@@ ce to explain all of us and everything we see .
in fact , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m finished . science will never go away .
i can see my work as a job . i do it for money .
so i looked for furniture .
he can seat , throughout the year , he can seat 8,000 people .
what came out of it ?
there is a full-@@ blown orchestra living inside the building .
these are some pictures visitors sent to me .
and the monkeys in that monkey forest looked , actually , fairly happy .
so even as we share death as a universal experience , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not experienced the same way the world over .
and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s also a moment of self-@@ awareness .
but i see something profoundly transformative in experiencing death as a social process and not just a biological one .
one of the -- thank you for inviting us .
but you do meet some fantastic people , people who look at the world in a totally different way .
&@@ quo@@ t@@ ; i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m sorry . i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve only got 18 minutes , 18 minutes to talk about saving the world , saving the planet , global institutions .
why would you do that ? why would -- it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s like one step up from replying to one of those emails from nigeria , isn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t it ?
but we have a new hope . we have a new man .
and he spoke to the crowd in chicago , he said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; if there is anyone out there who still doubts that america is a place where all things are possible ... &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
do you remember that ? george bush , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; a nu@@ -@@ ca-@@ ler . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
&@@ quo@@ t@@ ; i was held in prison for nearly 30 years on an island in the middle of the ocean .
and there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s lots of different shapes .
and so every time they found something that looked a little different , they named it something different .
they don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t like it if you come in and want to saw them open and look inside .
so people were looking at these and they were talking about how different they are .
what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s interesting is the spike on the back of the dra@@ cor@@ ex was growing very fast as well .
and then , because the juven@@ iles are in my collection , i cut them open and look inside .
here &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s another one .
now as you can imagine , this is not very popular with fourth-@@ gra@@ ders .
and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a responsive system that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s trained on actual weather .
anyway , moving along .
so , unfolded it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s about 300 linear feet .
the view is denied in the galleries where we receive just natural light , and then exposed again in the north gallery with a panor@@ ami@@ c view .
wait a minute , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s just in that state , we have a long way to go .
and this is a mock@@ up that is in salt lake city that gives you a sense of what this is going to look like in full-scale .
even in stories on gender-@@ based violence , men get an overwhelming majority of print space and air@@ time .
what she found was many of these stories tend to blame victims and de@@ value their lives .
putting them there made them more recognizable .
she was the cbs news correspondent who was brutally sexually assaulted in egypt &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s tah@@ ri@@ r square right after this photo was taken .
the botan@@ ical names are in front of you .
&@@ quo@@ t@@ ; be the change you want to see in the world , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; said mah@@ at@@ ma gandhi .
pm : so is this a good idea .
and so that happened more at various times , but i really think that there was a great advantage in many ways to being a woman .
so being an american , i decided to set up a caucus .
the other thing that i think is really important : a lot of national security policy isn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t just about foreign policy , but it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s about budgets , military budgets , and how the debts of countries work out .
so , yeah .
great news . it drives me nuts that most people don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t seem to know this news .
now i know that some of you think this progress is all in asia or latin america or model countries like brazil -- and who doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t love a brazilian model ? -- but look at sub-saharan africa .
right now today , in oslo as it happens , oil companies are fighting to keep secret their payments to governments for extra@@ cting oil in developing countries .
by doing so , you will join us and countless others in what i truly believe is the greatest adventure ever taken , the ever-@@ demanding journey of equality .
so now , if you take this metaphor &@@ #@@ 9@@ 1@@ ; of &@@ #@@ 93@@ ; genome as program seriously , you have to consider that chris anderson is a computer-@@ fabricated arti@@ fact , as is jim watson , craig vent@@ er , as are all of us .
you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to design something like a cell phone , and in a high-level language , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll describe that cell phone .
so , this is normal dna , what you think of as normal dna .
we heat them up , we add a little bit of salt , we heat them up to almost boiling and cool them down , and as we cool them down , the short strands bind the long strands and start to form structure .
she wrote all her own software to design and built this dna orig@@ ami , a beautiful rendition of china , which even has taiwan , and you can see it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s sort of on the world &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s shortest le@@ ash , right ?
it was started by erik win@@ free , and what it does , it has tiles that are a hundre@@ d@@ th the size of a dna orig@@ ami .
and if you do that , the orig@@ ami &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the same size , but the resulting square that you get is three times bigger .
and i think in the next five or 10 years , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll make the kind of squares that i described and maybe even get to some of those self-@@ assembled circu@@ its .
when life brought about a series of death and near-@@ death experiences within my close circle , which highlighted the need for an emergency medical response service in india , similar to 911 in usa .
yet , if you analyze the common man , he or she does not wake up every day and say , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; h@@ mm , let me see who i can pay a bri@@ be to today . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
it can be worth up to one trillion dollars , being paid in bri@@ bes every year , or equal to india &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s gdp .
a set of people actually say , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; oh , let me just grant it to them , and run away from it . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
so the data that you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got is a great thing called youtube , and we can go down and basically pull all the open information from youtube , all the comments , all the views , who &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s watching it , where are they watching it , what are they saying in the comments .
so as we go in here , what we start to see , apply the physics engine again , we see what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s one conversation is actually composed of many smaller ones .
well here &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s one by jessica green about the microbi@@ al ecology of buildings .
masculinity mimi@@ cked by men who grew up with no fathers , camou@@ f@@ lage worn by bul@@ lies who are dangerously armed but need hugs .
invest , invest , invest . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
a wise person knows how to improvi@@ se , as luke did when he re-@@ washed the floor .
all they had was mike &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s hard lemon@@ ade , which was five percent alcohol .
we can certainly see this in response to the current financial crisis .
don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t get me wrong . we need rules !
all we ask is , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; what serves my interests ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
be proud that you have them .
so there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a lot here at ted , and at other places , to celebrate .
if you do that , the rest is just pretty much a coast downhill .
they have a particular interest in ones that will help our soldiers .
they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve been watching too much &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; termin@@ ator . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
it turned out , as i think you could see in ai@@ mee &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s capabilities and attitudes , people with a desire to do something are quite remarkable and nature is quite ada@@ ptable .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll give you some asto@@ unding things that have happened as we started this .
he was leaning on his other arm .
and i get a call and we go back to washington .
i said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; what am i going to say ?
it is an easy answer .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the path@@ finder that shows us a simple road through an im@@ pene@@ tra@@ ble moral ma@@ ze .
the earth moved for both of them .
there was so many skep@@ tics , especially the press in london , that they started flying cheese@@ burgers on helicopters around my box to tem@@ pt me .
so , i went to talk to a doctor friend , and i asked him how could i do that ?
and then there is static ap@@ ne@@ a .
he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s six foot four . he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s 160 pounds .
this was a critical mistake .
and what he did in response , is he went on reg@@ is and kelly , and broke his old record .
which was making me more nervous .
it was awful .
i was like &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; what ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
now what we can do is point at the front of the newspaper and immediately get the bulletin .
teacher : now move it either side . see what happens .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s just going to do a tiny bit of processing to convert that image that we just took into a sort of digital fingerprint , and the great thing is , if you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re a professional user , -- so , a newspaper -- the tools are pretty much identical to what we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve just used to create this demonstration .
for those of us in this room , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not just the poorest and the most vulnerable individual , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the community , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the culture , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the world itself .
last week , bill clinton at the ted awards said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; this situation is unprecedented , un@@ equal , unfair and unstable . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
many of you , i think , have probably trek@@ ked here .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve seen the eradi@@ cation of smallpox .
it is something to be greatly optimistic about .
and when they did , they took smallpox to 10 other countries and reign@@ ited the epidemic .
there isn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t a dog on this earth that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a natural creature .
well , they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve now taken that gene , that bi@@ olu@@ min@@ esc@@ ent gene , and put it into mam@@ mal cells .
so even as we worry about it , we have allowed it to go on in this country -- much different in europe -- without any regulation , and even without any identification on the package .
and it raises the question of how we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to define animal species in the age of bio@@ technology -- a question that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re not really sure yet how to solve .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve taken away the autonomy of this animal . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
this is a mouse created by charles vac@@ anti of the university of massachusetts .
we are directly designing the future of the species of this planet .
and he went on to say , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; these differences do not coincide with corresponding differences in climate . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
but uv@@ b and u@@ va especially , came in un@@ impe@@ ded .
there was natural selection for the evolution of lightly pig@@ mented skin .
so we have , in skin pig@@ mentation , one of these wonderful products of evolution that still has consequences for us today .
you , you can teach it .
so let me show you a few objects .
to the right , i took a higher rou@@ gh@@ ness .
why so ? because , in fact , the area of the lung is something very ill-@@ defined .
well , they do mix .
i played with it for a while , and i made it return to the origin .
so the idea there was that one must be able to -- how do you say ? -- model price variation .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s so un@@ interesting .
beno@@ it mandel@@ brot : fra@@ ct@@ als and the art of rou@@ gh@@ ness
so , imagine that all of you are participants in the study .
here &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s an example of the puzzle you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to solve .
so , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re putting in less juice , and therefore the outcome : fewer puzzles solved .
right ? a patient in the driver &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s seat , for example .
not because there was not enough food -- because there was actually a surplus of food in the fertile regions of the south parts of the country -- but because in the north , people could not access or entit@@ le themselves to that food .
did our farmers turn into highly productive commercial actors ?
to give you an example , between 2001 and 2002 , ethiopian mai@@ ze farmers produced two years of bumper harvest .
in the american midwest , farmers used to load grain onto bar@@ ges and send it upri@@ ver to the chicago market .
that means that the exchange will operate a trading system , which will initially start as an open outcry , because we don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t think the country &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s ready for full electronic trading .
we believe that the stakes are high , but that the returns will be even greater .
it is always the same , never the same , endlessly fascinating .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a potential scenario if we fail to take this seriously .
it provides a physical support structure for the trees , and it creates physical spaces , hab@@ itable spaces inside of the sand dun@@ es .
then , a few years afterwards , using per@@ mac@@ ul@@ tural strategies , we green that part of the desert .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not only something that supports trees , but something that connects people and countries together .
i paid to get it repaired -- then it broke again .
if this idea is truly sound , then the implications are significant .
he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s bare@@ foot . he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll run back into his house , and he will contamin@@ ate his drinking water and his food and his environment with whatever diseases he may be carrying by fe@@ cal particles that are on his fingers and feet .
we don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t have a neutral word for it .
and you might think it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s just good karma to see these guys stirring shit , but it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s also good economic sense , because they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re saving a million dollars a year .
she grew up in a rural village in a poor area of india , and she was engaged at 14 , and then at 21 or so , she moved into her in-law &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s house .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the most off-@@ track millennium development goal .
and that was what i did .
there are tens of thousands of those stories out there , and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s really hard to con@@ jure up much of a sense of well-being , because it just keeps getting worse .
and we tra@@ wl , which means to take something the size of a tractor trailer truck that weighs thousands and thousands of pounds , put it on a big chain , and drag it across the sea floor to stir up the bottom and catch the fish .
but since we ate all the oy@@ sters and we ate all the fish that would eat the plan@@ k@@ ton , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s nothing to eat the plan@@ k@@ ton and there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s more and more of it , so it dies of old age , which is un@@ heard of for plan@@ k@@ ton .
and then , of course , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s climate change , and we all know about climate change .
but there are these , what we call , positive feed@@ backs , the syner@@ gies among them that make the whole vastly greater than the sum of the parts .
in this bracing talk , coral reef ecolo@@ gist jeremy jackson lays out the shocking state of the ocean today : over@@ fi@@ shed , over@@ heated , pollut@@ ed , with indicators that things will get much worse . astonishing photos and stats make the case .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s -- that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not true .
that this old man would inter@@ rupt his moon@@ light stroll with his sweethe@@ art with the precise reason of making fun of a child .
i went with my friend tim mc@@ gon@@ ig@@ al , who sat on my left .
the sand@@ worms were fine , but your favorite character ?
does something seem strange about this to you ?
she was a single woman about to go alone into a country , not even speaking the language , to travel alone by bus and boat to go to a beach she did not know or had never seen .
she was smiling . she did not understand why i was so worried .
but i think we should also just check the numbers , take a reality check here .
joseph schum@@ peter called this &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; the process of creative destruction . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
is this really how economies behave ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
what is the objective ?
what does all this mean for economics ?
but it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s also clear that prosperity goes beyond this .
i mean , can you picture a politician standing up in britain and saying , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; gdp fell two percent this year . good news !
i painted it directly on top of the man .
i made the tough decision of going home after graduation and not going up to capitol hill , but going down to my parents &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; basement and making it my job to learn how to paint .
when we started out on the milk project , and when i started out , i couldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t have foreseen that i would go from pursuing my dream in politics and working at a desk to tri@@ pping over a shadow and then turning people into paintings and painting on people in a pool of milk .
and it goes all the way over to these big , thick , gal@@ um@@ phy ones that have hundreds of carb@@ ons , and they have thousands of hydro@@ gens , and they have van@@ adi@@ um and heavy metals and sul@@ fur and all kinds of cra@@ ziness hanging off the sides of them .
they set the prices , and i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t even know .
okay , so the politics of oil are very moral in the united states .
and we take it as , you know -- we look at it on a moral level , rather than looking at it on a legal and financial level .
in fact , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s continued to increase .
this is 1988 -- we actually bombed two iranian oil platforms that year .
what you see in this top drawing is a schem@@ atic of how petroleum gets used in the u.s. economy .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a lot .
we are running late .
now you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d think that &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; american idol &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; would introduce a measure of ameri@@ can@@ i@@ zation .
and that swim took me 18 minutes and 50 seconds , and it felt like 18 days .
and to the right hand side of us was this great k@@ hum@@ bu glacier .
we want you to walk up the hill in another two days &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; time .
after he sw@@ am the north pole , lewis pugh vowed never to take another cold-@@ water dip . then he heard of lake im@@ ja in the himal@@ ay@@ as , created by recent gla@@ cial melting , and lake pum@@ ori , a body of water at an altitude of 5@@ 300 m on everest -- and so began a journey that would teach him a radical new way to approach swimming and think about climate change .
this is a state di@@ agra@@ m . that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s an extremely simple computer .
i thought about this in the sense that it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s great to build in biological materials , but can we do similar things ?
so i was trying to , you know , take the engineer &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s version : can we build a mechanical system in in@@ organic materials that will do the same thing ?
and literally with only those two inputs -- so , the shape of your boundary condition and the pressure -- you can define an infinite number of lenses that cover the range of human refra@@ ctive error , from minus 12 to plus eight di@@ op@@ ters , up to four di@@ op@@ ters of cy@@ linder .
but they can show you how to build things in sequence .
you could just hang it as a bed sheet , but again , the comput@@ ation of all the physics gives you the aer@@ ody@@ na@@ mic shape .
and the cor@@ relation , of course , is that den@@ ser places tend to have lower emissions -- which isn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t really all that difficult to figure out , if you think about it .
this is a ma@@ p@@ nifi@@ cent map that shows me , in this case , how far i can get from my home in 30 minutes using public transportation .
which brings on another threshold effect i like to call fur@@ n@@ ace dumping , which is , quite simply , if you have a building that doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t need to be heated with a fur@@ n@@ ace , you save a whole bunch of money up front .
during the twen@@ tie@@ th century , we witnessed the atrocities of stalin , hitler , mao , pol pot , rwanda and other geno@@ cides , and even though the twenty-@@ first century is only seven years old , we have already witnessed an ongoing genocide in dar@@ fur and the daily horrors of iraq .
according to non-@@ governmental organizations that keep such statistics , since 1945 , in europe and the americas , there has been a steep decline in interstate wars , in deadly ethnic riots or pogro@@ ms , and in military cou@@ ps , even in south america . worldwide , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s been a steep decline in deaths in interstate wars . the yellow bars here show the number of deaths per war per year from 1950 to the present .
so that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a bit of a support for the levi@@ athan theory .
in fact , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s as large as western europe , but it only has 300 miles of paved roads .
now these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking about just before they go get a con@@ dom .
and what is the definition then ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; the definition ?
we have liberia . we have congo .
you can watch me for one minute now and you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll see the whole thing .
and asia could have social development before they got the economic development .
but more or less , this is what will happen , and we have a world which cannot be looked upon as divided .
and then it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s united states today , up here .
and we had an increase in income .
the middle income countries , the emerging economy , they are catching up .
about 20 percent of the adult population are infected .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s caused by fast processing of toxic cas@@ sa@@ va root in famine situation .
and we have a high hope in you . thank you very much .
next best thing to a video game .
you have them in h@@ unter-@@ gather@@ er societies , but then through technological evolution , new forms of technology arise that facilitate or encourage the playing of non-@@ zero-@@ sum games , involving more people over larger territory .
and i would say the non-@@ zero-@@ sum dynamic is only going to grow more intense over time because of technological trends , but more intense in a kind of negative way .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s when people &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s fortunes are cor@@ related .
i think it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the first step toward that . that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the long-term goal .
the g@@ 8 summit proposes that the solution to africa &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s problems should be a massive increase in aid , something akin to the marshall plan .
but equally , it has opportunities and a lot of potential .
well , since i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m not seeing the hand , it appears that what i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m stating is true .
well , because it gives them good , paying jobs , or , in many african countries , unofficial opportunities to profit from corruption .
governments are not changing it . why ?
there were 56 , and when our president wanted to amend the constitution and remove term limits , he had to create 25 new districts , and now there are 81 .
doctor seli@@ gman , what is the state of psychology today ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and the conclusion of that is that psychology and psychiat@@ ry , over the last 60 years , can actually claim that we can make miserable people less miserable .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve spent my life working on extremely miserable people , and i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve asked the question , how do extremely miserable people differ from the rest of you ?
so i want to say a little bit about each of those lives and what we know about them .
when he walks onto the floor of the american exchange at 9 : 30 in the morning , time stops for him . and it stops till the closing bell .
and meaning , in this view , consists of -- very parallel to eu@@ daim@@ onia -- it consists of knowing what your highest strengths are , and using them to belong to and in the service of something larger than you are .
so , the next to last thing i want to say is we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re interested in how much life satisfaction people have .
but they were empty .
these are cam@@ els moving across the rift valley in africa , photographed by chris johns .
now i have to tell you , i was talking to kyle last week about this , that i was going to tell this story .
a lion having a late night snack -- notice he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s got a broken tooth .
for the first time in history , more people live in urban , rather than rural , environments .
brian photographed a marine sanctuary in new zealand , where commercial fishing had been banned -- the result being that the over@@ fi@@ shed species have been restored , and with them a possible solution for sustainable fisheries .
but then paul got in the water .
david griffin : how photography connects us
so , if we use information that comes off of this spe@@ cular reflection , we can go from a traditional face scan that might have the gross con@@ tours of the face and the basic shape , and au@@ gment it with information that puts in all of that skin por@@ e structure and fine wrinkles .
we can turn the volume up a little bit if that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s available .
what i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve been doing from 14 to 17 was , i was assisting them collecting ivory tu@@ sk , meat and whatever they were killing , po@@ aching , hunting in the forest , bring it in the main city to get access to the market .
here we have sav@@ anna gi@@ raff@@ es , but through evolution we have this forest gi@@ ra@@ ffe that lives only in congo .
you can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t ask him how old he is because he has guns .
and that was the language of the war .
and they can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t do what they are doing .
and one day , we went for a meeting .
i oppose it -- that they are now going to dis@@ se@@ ct it , until i do my report and then i see the chief commander .
see what the wars in rwanda .
building capacities for the young generation is going to make a better generation and a better future tomorrow for africa .
did you know that , in iraq and afghanistan , there were more private military contractors on the ground than there were u.s. military troops ?
let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s see what people here think about it .
oh , after you stopped paying .
for fear of disagreement , we shrink from these questions .
some of the reasons for this are not really very controversial .
the vertical axis now is thousands of dollars in today &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s prices .
all the rest went to the top one percent .
that comes out at five to 10 tons daily per square mile in cities .
you have to choose either option a or option b .
and some people would say that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re born with it in some other means .
everything except random@@ ness . she did not believe in random@@ ness .
and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what i look for in my work , a personal meaning .
but , both of these say@@ ings -- saving a fish from drowning , or saving a man from drowning -- to me they had to do with intentions .
it may be something that is perhaps more serious -- as i said , human rights in bur@@ ma .
well , what is random ? what is chance ? what is luck ?
i was able to see that in a firsthand way , when i went to beautiful dong village , in gui@@ zhou , the poorest province of china .
i believe in specifics , the specifics of story , and the past , the specifics of that past , and what is happening in the story at that point .
and the reason is that until wonder came along and figured out how to spread the idea of sliced bread , no one wanted it .
right . i go to the deli ; i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m sick ; i need to buy some medicine .
who &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s going to stop and pull over and say -- oh , look , a cow . nobody .
they turned a chair from something the purchasing department bought , to something that was a status symbol about where you sat at work .
talk to them and make it easy for them to tell their friends .
ami@@ ho@@ tor@@ not@@ .com -- everyday 250,000 people go to this site , run by two volunteers , and i can tell you they are hard gra@@ ders , and they didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t get this way by advertising a lot .
silk . put a product that does not need to be in the refriger@@ ated section next to the milk in the refriger@@ ated section .
in a world of too many options and too little time , our obvious choice is to just ignore the ordinary stuff . marketing guru seth go@@ din spells out why , when it comes to getting our attention , bad or bizarre ideas are more successful than boring ones .
now , speaking of walls , i want to share with you the story of one wall in cairo .
most of the economic models are built around scarcity and growth .
if we can make it through the next 150 years , i think that your great great grandchildren will forget all about mal@@ thus .
the problem is that these pu@@ ps need a stable platform of solid ice in order to nurse from their moms .
we can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t keep taking without expecting serious consequences as a result .
i didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t want them to be overly threatening or scary .
here we see a female craw@@ ling out of the ocean under moon@@ light on the island of tr@@ ini@@ dad .
72 percent of the population has such scars , but most don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t shed the gear , things like lobster traps and crab pots .
i worked in other parts of new zealand as well , in beautiful , fragile , protected areas like in fi@@ ord@@ land , where this sea pen colony was found .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s horrible . it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a proof of our failing to save them in the wild .
when i stood there in the grass , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s hot -- not even the sound of insects -- just this waving grass .
now in this recipe you also have the cost .
and once the soil gets dried , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re in a dry season -- you get cracks , oxygen goes in , flames come out and the problem starts all over again .
but , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s more complicated . it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not that simple , and you have to work with the people .
and this is after two years .
and look , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s now 11.@@ 2 percent more clouds -- already , after three years .
but whatever you do in that program , it has to be fully supported by the people , meaning that you also have to adjust it to the local , cultural values .
all the sculptures move by mechanical means .
it sounds good , but i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll bet you know in your gut that it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not the whole truth , and i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll tell you why .
and i waited , and the next day i liked it a bit better , the next day i liked it a bit better , and now i really love it .
free@@ ways .
what i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m trying to say is the major contribution on carbon emissions are from the cars -- more than 50 percent -- so when we depend only on cars , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s ...
you should have always a structure of living and working together .
and we cannot have all the answers .
okay , now why then is this curious reluctance and curious hostility to consciousness ?
how could spiritu@@ ality move anything ?
and just as the jar full of water can go from liquid to solid depending on the behavior of the molecules , so your brain can go from a state of being conscious to a state of being unconscious , depending on the behavior of the molecules .
okay , the next feature of consciousness , after this marvel@@ ous unified conscious field , is that it functions caus@@ ally in our behavior .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s only relative to conscious agents that a piece of paper is money or that a bunch of buildings is a university .
i won &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t demonstrate pain behavior , but i can tell you i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m not having any pains right now .
but i believe there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a second climate crisis , which is as severe , which has the same origins , and that we have to deal with with the same urgency .
and human resources are like natural resources ; they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re often buried deep .
we must disen@@ th@@ r@@ all ourselves , and then we shall save our country . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
she doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t see the point .
he said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; as a kid . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; he said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; actually , it was a problem for me at school , because at school , everybody wanted to be a fire@@ man . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
&@@ quo@@ t@@ ; you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve been around for 36 months , and this is it ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
you know this , if you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re doing something you love , an hour feels like five minutes .
he wrote this to his love , mau@@ d gon@@ ne , and he was be@@ wa@@ iling the fact that he couldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t really give her what he thought she wanted from him .
now what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s interesting about that is irregular ver@@ bs between alfred and ja@@ y-@@ z have become more regular .
so i think in the next decade , the sciences and the human@@ ities will come closer together to be able to answer deep questions about man@@ kind .
and so i got some training and went and worked in africa during most of my 20s .
and she walked forward with such calm and such clarity and such total lack of fear that she could walk right up to the first gun , put her hand on it and lower it .
but anger is like gasoline , and if you spray it around and somebody lights a match , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got an infer@@ no .
and what they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve realized is that using violence in the situations they operate in is not only less humane , but it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s less effective than using methods that connect people with people , that rebuild .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s flown around the world .
do you mind if we do something completely different ?
you could say , well , it doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t look very different from when he started .
and is art about trying to imagine what lies beyond the horizon ?
if you look down , you can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t see your feet .
and thanks to the people of interface , i have become a recovering plunder@@ er .
thinking it through , i realized that all those attributes must be changed to move t to the denomin@@ ator .
we reckon that we are a bit over halfway to our goal : zero impact , zero footprint .
i remain troubled by the revised ehrlich equation , i equals p times a divided by t@@ 2 .
because it told me , by god , one person got it .
while we initially heral@@ ded the internet as the fantastic new marketing device that was going to solve all our problems , we now realize that the internet is , if anything , too effective in that regard .
and at heart , both reform@@ ations , i think were asking the questions : who &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s entitled to practice ?
today &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s professional theater community is defined , not only the shaw and strat@@ ford festivals , but by the cornerstone theater of los angeles -- a collective of artists that after 9 / 11 , brought together 10 different religious communities -- the bah@@ ia , the catholic , the muslim , the jewish , even the native american and the gay and lesbian communities of faith , helping them create their own individual plays and one massive play , where they explored the differences in their faith and found common@@ ality as an important first step toward cross-@@ community healing .
we want to play you one more selection .
and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s how i got out of high school .
at a reception in their courtyard , i noticed that they had a fountain because they think that the people who go to the museum deserve a fountain .
and so the next thing you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll see is a million dollar kitchen that was built by the heinz company -- you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve heard of them ?
we have students who sit together , black kids and white kids , and what we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve discovered is you can solve the race problem by creating a world class environment , because people will have a tendency to show you world class behavior if you treat them in that way .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s our library with more hand@@ crafted furniture .
he was dragging guys out of bars and saving those lives for the lord .
she said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; well , i work for a company called he@@ w@@ le@@ tt-@@ pac@@ kar@@ d . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and i want my music to be with you . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the building , and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the model , and on the right &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a high-tech greenhouse and in the middle &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the medical technology building .
this is in a place called san francisco .
i said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; well , that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s very nice .
because mr. ross used to bring in your albums when i was 16 years old in the po@@ ttery class , when the world was all dark , and your music got me to the sunlight . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s really our first for@@ ay into this .
so it consists of two parts , what we call an en@@ co@@ der and a trans@@ du@@ cer .
so let me show you , and i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to start with the standard method first .
this man is supposed to represent a generic human being , and all of the circles in that man are all of the cells that make up your body .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re not doing anything to the cells here .
this is like the stealth bomber of the ocean .
this is the vi@@ bri@@ o fischer@@ i molecule .
they take that information inside , and they decide what tasks to carry out depending on who &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s in the minority and who &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s in the majority of any given population .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve also done the same thing with the pink system .
this is exactly what happens in your body .
look at all the arguments we have these days over health care , over bonuses and bail@@ outs on wall street , over the gap between rich and poor , over affirmative action and same-sex marriage .
actually , that was aristo@@ tle &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s answer too .
he was a very good golfer , but he had a disability .
what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s your name ?
is walking the course essential to the game ?
first , no real sports fan would talk that way .
so let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s step back from these cases and see how they shed light on the way we might improve , elevate , the terms of political discourse in the united states , and for that matter , around the world .
michael san@@ del : the lost art of democratic debate
you know , a lot of people said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; well , you know , city boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time .
and , i say that that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s fine -- the future of humanity is entitled to make that choice .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve discovered things like , for example , rna interference only a few years ago , and this is a really fundamental component of how cells work .
the therapies will be improving faster than the remaining im@@ perfe@@ ctions in the therapies are catching up with us .
secondly , what does it mean for the public &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s perception of how long it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s going to take for us to get to those things , starting from the time we get the mice ?
we can call it the &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; engineering approach , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; and i claim that the engineering approach is within range .
some of them are partially implemented already , the ones at the top .
audience : species on this planet have evolved with immune systems to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to pro@@ create .
there are species that have no aging -- hy@@ dra for example -- but they do it by not having a nervous system -- and not having any tissues in fact that rely for their function on very long-@@ lived cells .
and although i want to thank the talented people of our company foremost for that -- and also there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a factor of luck and timing -- we are absolutely convinced that we did this because of our values .
i have days that i believe , but i have days that i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m full of doubt .
so we should embrace our difference and aim for challenge .
what happens when a city decides it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s going to set other priorities ?
according to the center for disease control , fully one third of all children born after 2000 will get diabetes .
and we take car crashes for granted .
but , of course , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve seen what that does .
you don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t want to tell americans , god for@@ bid , that they have to change their lifestyle .
the second reason is that we killed these things .
well , we looked at the tissue under the micro@@ scope .
the first one that we see occurs in the ancient rain@@ forests of australia about 25 million years ago , and the national geographic society is helping us to explore these fossil deposits . this is ri@@ vers@@ leigh .
wild dogs did eat a few of the sheep , but the thy@@ la@@ cine got a bad rap .
they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re related distan@@ tly to thy@@ la@@ cin@@ es .
he thought hard . i mean , it was nearly 80 years before this that he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d been at this hut .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s very , very difficult to speak at the end of a conference like this , because everyone has spoken . everything has been said .
now , why is all this important , to have to go really fast ?
creating our own program to solve problems , like fighting corruption , building institutions , stabili@@ zing the micro economy .
is it being directed effectively ?
it was really hot . i was very hungry .
and now let me become less sentimental , and say that saving lives -- which some of the aid we get does on this continent -- when you save the life of anyone , a farmer , a teacher , a mother , they are contributing produ@@ ctively into the economy .
when we ask them and tell them what we need , one of my worries today is that we have many foundations now .
our inability to take charge and say to all these people bringing their money , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; sit down . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
aid cannot solve our problems , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m firmly convinced about that .
a lot has been said here about women , i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t need to repeat it .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to go over some science experiments and try to cover three musical experiments .
and so all of us have this remarkable brain , which is poorly understood to say the least .
you can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t just sort of -- &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s great we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got this keyboard . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
really , consciousness is seated in the frontal lo@@ be .
cl : at this point , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll take a few moments .
so what we had them do was memori@@ ze this lower-@@ left sound icon , please .
so just to conclude , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got a lot of questions to ask , and like i said , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll ask questions here , not answer them .
look , the world has changed from analog to digital .
a technician will put the electro@@ des onto the scalp using a condu@@ ctive gel or paste and usually after a procedure of preparing the scalp by light abra@@ sion .
the first time , nothing will happen , because the system has no idea how he thinks about &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; pull . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and once you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve trained up the dete@@ ctions , these thoughts can be assigned or ma@@ pped to any computing platform , application or device .
so i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to briefly discuss a couple of problems that we have and a couple of problems where we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got some solutions underway .
esther du@@ flo talked a little bit about this .
the other thing is , you know , it would be even better if you didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t have to draw the blood .
there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s all these different interventions but they have different kinds of effectiveness .
in 1935 , there were 150,000 cases a year of malaria in the united states , but d@@ dt and a massive public health effort managed to squ@@ el@@ ch it .
now , it turns out we only kill the female mosquit@@ oes .
here we have it running at high-speed mode .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s then sold and bought , and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s then delivered to me .
but i thought , no , no , experiment with re@@ sins , experiment with pol@@ ym@@ ers .
three compost bins -- go through about 70 ki@@ los of raw vegetable waste a week -- really good , makes fantastic compost .
very advanced , no air-@@ conditioning -- i love it .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s zero food waste .
basically i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m recording one second of every day of my life for the rest of my life , chron@@ ologi@@ cally com@@ piling these one-@@ second tiny slices of my life into one single continuous video until , you know , i can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t record them anymore .
it helped me realize something else during this project , is that recording that one second on a really bad day is extremely difficult .
and we can start a film about that , and we can see a little bit backwards in time .
these are the distances of the tubes which make it walk that way .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a binary step counter .
you can only do them one at a time .
i think philosophi@@ cally , that was one of the most important papers that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve ever done because it showed how dynamic life was .
so the team developed new debu@@ gging software , where we could test each synthetic frag@@ ment to see if it would grow in a background of wild type dna .
and we added three quo@@ tations , because with the first genome we were criticized for not trying to say something more profound than just signing the work .
or , more importantly , hiv , where the virus evol@@ ves so quickly the vaccines that are made today can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t keep up with those evolutionary changes .
so i read slowly .
this was perhaps the biggest surprise -- how flexible the kor@@ an is , at least in minds that are not fundamentally in@@ flexible .
i study ants , and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s because i like to think about how organizations work .
and they do that by each year sending out the re@@ produ@@ ctives -- those are the ones with wings -- on a mat@@ ing flight .
and it stays that size until the queen dies and there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s nobody to make more ants , when she &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s about 15 or 20 years old .
on one day , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll all be here , and then the next day they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll move it over there , and then they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll move it back .
they somehow get into this reserve .
well it turns out that yes , the different tasks are inter@@ dependent .
so , the ants in the older colony that seem to be more stable are not any older than the ants in the younger colony .
they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve gone out to do different tasks , and the rate at which they meet as they come in and out of the nest entrance determines , or influences , each ant &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s decision about whether to go out , and which task to perform .
but in a small colony , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s likely to meet fewer for@@ a@@ gers , just because there are fewer other for@@ a@@ gers there to meet .
but it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the greatest transfer of wealth , from one group to another in the history of man@@ kind .
yes , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s going to continue .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s 130 oc@@ tane fuel .
i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t have to worry about the bridge to where at my age .
in a nut@@ shell that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what happened ?
and so everyone can be at least happy to see a shift from coal or oil to natural gas .
and number two , do not build a re@@ former on the ocean .
i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t understand why the media is focused on eastern pennsylvania .
boone , i really , really appreciate you coming here , engaging in this conversation .
&@@ quo@@ t@@ ; the el@@ dor@@ ado of the united states of america : the discovery of in@@ exhau@@ stible gold mines in california . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
half of them deserted to go look for gold .
but they spent three and a half million dollars in the 2000 super bowl to air that ad , even though , at the time , they only had a million dollars in annual revenue .
this is work going on down in lower manhattan where they built some of the first electric power generating stations .
this came in , like , six different colors .
i mean , you didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t want this thing clo@@ gging up a light so@@ cket .
and one friend of mine was telling me a story : not only did they get there and have to wait , but then the engineers , when they finally did get there , for the third time , they had to call somebody .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to try to give you a little bit of a natural history of compassion and the golden rule .
now , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s more good news that came along later in evolution , a second kind of evolutionary logic .
now , we have a rationale for that .
and if you ask what kind of situation is condu@@ ci@@ ve to people defining people as enemies , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a zero-@@ sum situation .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s why social organization has grown from the h@@ unter-@@ gather@@ er village to the ancient state , the empire , and now here we are in a glob@@ alized world .
i think politicians can help foster non-@@ zero-@@ sum relationships , economic engagement is generally better than block@@ ades and so on , in this regard .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s unfortunate that they tend to be sele@@ ctively deployed .
what time of life had they started school ?
he actively sought dis@@ confirmation .
in surveys of european and american executives , fully 85 percent of them acknowledged that they had issues or concerns at work that they were afraid to raise .
but he had been so afraid of conflict , until finally he became more afraid of the silence .
so , what people were saying to me about the cause of cancer , sources of cancer , or , for that matter , why you are who you are , didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t make sense .
so , i decided over the years , because of a series of experiments that this is because of context and architecture .
and we said , wonderful ! look at this pretty structure .
i made a radical hypothe@@ sis .
we have shown that there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s little pieces of dna on the specific genes of the mam@@ mary g@@ land that actually respond to extra@@ cellular matrix .
but here is a poem from ye@@ ats . i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll just read you the last two lines .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s been fantastic .
it sounds a little bit like a weird book , but actually they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re all new types of lies .
he wrote very , very positive reviews about himself . surprise , surprise .
my friends , no way they can be that cool and have good of a life .
well , to do that , one thing is we can look at the de@@ cep@@ tion-@@ detection literature .
anybody do any writing today ? did anybody write a word ?
those cold , hard winters , i love it .
now , when you are about to say or do something , we can think , do i want this to be part of my legacy , part of my personal record ?
though in all seriousness , this position that you just saw me in , looking down at my phone , that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s one of the reasons behind this project , project glass .
we had to keep it secret from our industrial designer until she actually accepted the job , and then she almost ran away screaming .
but i do that all the time .
i go back to color all the time .
my mother was , sort of , very sensitive to his mother , who it seemed was a little bit skeptical about the whole alternative lifestyle thing .
i went to performing arts high school , where i was an actor .
and so i had this t.@@ v. show .
and there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s got to be some way to do that , rosie .
and i often look at things as though they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re food .
chef : oh , you don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t know ? let me tell you something .
fashion designer isaac mi@@ z@@ rah@@ i spins through a di@@ zz@@ ying array of inspir@@ ations -- from &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; 50s pin@@ ups to a fle@@ eting glimpse of a woman on the street who makes him shout &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; stop the cab ! &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; inside this ra@@ mbling talk are real clues to living a happy , creative life .
and i was actually a potent force in spreading ideas across borders , and i witnessed the rise of islamist extremism as distinct from islam the faith , and the way in which it influenced my co-@@ religi@@ oni@@ sts across the world .
what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s actually happening is that what were previously lo@@ cali@@ zed paro@@ chi@@ alis@@ ms , individual or group@@ ings of extremists who were isolated from one another , have become inter@@ connected in a glob@@ alized way and have thus become , or are becoming , mainstream .
and a social movement is comprised , in my view , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s comprised of four main characteristics .
the second , i believe , is political correc@@ tness .
not exclusive to these things , but in addition to them , is propag@@ ating a genuine demand for democracy on the ground .
because it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not enough to remove a leader or ruler or dictator .
it isn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t when the shiny new tools show up that their uses start per@@ me@@ ating society .
the internet is the first medium in history that has native support for groups and conversation at the same time .
the bbc got their first wind of the chinese quake from twitter .
and finally the chinese cracked down .
all of that is over .
he had to issue a reply .
ok , this is mount everest .
it was a national geographic expedition , but it was organized by the explor@@ ers club .
there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s no ice over it .
from here , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s about 1,500 feet up at a 30-@@ degree angle to the summit .
this is a view taken along the summit ridge .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s really cold ; it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s 24@@ ,000 feet .
the survivors came in one by one .
after laying in the snow that long a time , he got up and found his way back to the camp .
he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s dying .
he was critically ill , there were other critically ill patients ; luckily , we were able to get a helicopter in to rescue these guys .
so ideas change states .
but a demographic dividend is only as good as the investment in your human capital .
and then i think the other point is that indians today are far more comfortable with glob@@ alization .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s certainly not like china .
what are those ideas ? one is , i think , are ideological issues .
we can use technology for transparency , and many other things .
if we really want to come to a point , we really want to put a cap on our carbon emission , we want to really lower the use of energy -- it has to be solved in countries like india .
and this is a rainy election day in a small country -- that can be my country , but could be also your country .
so basically i want to ask : what went right and what went wrong in these 50 years when we talk about democracy ?
and you have the market revolution of the 1980s and the huge increase of inequality in societies .
you have facebook revolu@@ tions , twitter revolu@@ tions .
in a small country that could be my country , but could be also your country , they took a decision -- it is a real case story -- that all of the governmental decisions , discussions of the council of ministers , were going to be published on the internet 24 hours after the council discussions took place .
the idea is called the social impact bond .
the service providers , well , for the first time , they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got an opportunity to provide services and grow the evidence for what they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re doing in a really constructive way and learn and demonstrate the value of what they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re doing over five or six years , not just one or two as often happens at the moment .
it enables testing of new ideas in a way that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s less difficult for everybody .
&@@ quo@@ t@@ ; ha , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m the only person i ever loved . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
he goes , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; sir , why don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t you drive ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
why is that ? are you too tired to go all the way around ?
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m not supposed to be , like , walking down the aisle , and be like , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; hi , jack . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; you know , that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not cool .
was@@ su@@ p .
ted@@ x .
decided to use recycled content from cement and steel manufacturing .
we must change everything .
it is transparent , made just for you .
they were missing the vision .
so once those pictures are acquired and the physician has drawn all the necessary safety limits and so on , he sele@@ cts basically a point -- you see the round point in the middle where the cur@@ sor is -- and he presses this blue button called &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; son@@ i@@ cate . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
john is one of &@@ #@@ 9@@ 1@@ ; about &@@ #@@ 93@@ ; a dozen very heroic , courageous people who volunteered for the study .
he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a 78 year-old farmer who suffered from -- how should i say it ? -- it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s called pain in the butt .
i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t see , without this nation taking it as some collective will or something that is a national goal to make that happen , it will not happen .
so new life was born .
all they have , really , is trademark protection , and so it means that anybody could copy any garment on any person in this room and sell it as their own design .
now , fashion designers have the bro@@ a@@ dest palette imagin@@ able in this creative industry .
one that a lot of cultural critics have pointed to is that we now have a much broader palette of design choices to choose from than we ever have before , and this is mainly because of the fast fashion industry , actually .
i love these galli@@ anos .
if you look at the registry , actually , a lot of the registered things in the e.@@ u .
fireworks displays , the smell of perfume : no .
it is barely te@@ thered to any sort of physical reality in our minds .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d been traveling in japan without an agenda other than to photograph , and then i heard about this tree that is 2,@@ 180 years old and knew that i had to go visit it .
and then this back down on the ground and you can see that the fung@@ us is actually invading this tree .
but i put that slide in there because i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m often asked if there are any animals in the project .
and what looks like two big he@@ aps of leaves , is actually two single leaves that get shred@@ ded up by the harsh desert conditions over time .

you could rob 200 people on a train , a great innovation .
you see , if you can print in metal , you can print one of these , and in fact you can also print one of these too .
and to hackers , dna is just another operating system waiting to be hacked .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what i get asked all the time .
the threat is serious , and the time to prepare for it is now .
will i be marginalized ?
and when we think about legacy , i can think of no more powerful one , despite how short her life was .
and there is no group more vulnerable to those kinds of manipul@@ ations than young men .
i know it works .

the talk will be broadly about energy , but oil &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a good place to start .
and so , 25 years ago , there was a peak oil ; just like , in the 1920s , there was a peak coal ; and a hundred years before that , there was a peak wood .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not different , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the same stuff : calcium carbon@@ ate , calcium carbon@@ ate .

one is the large global economy , the large glob@@ alized economy , and the other one is the small , and very limited , capacity of our traditional governments and their international institutions to govern , to shape , this economy .
we are not talking about 50,000 dollars here , or 100,000 dollars there , or one million dollars there .
well , thank you . i mean , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s interesting , in doing this , we had to sit together with the companies .
in germany , we have a system where you are not allowed to bri@@ be a civil servant , but you are allowed to bri@@ be a deputy .

i kept thinking of beds and red cheeks , and of course i kept thinking of sex when i looked at him , and i thought , is that what he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s thinking about ?
but it is difficult to hear the words aloud .
there was hollywood .
so when i read in a newspaper in the business page the story of nol@@ lywood , i really felt this is an incredible opportunity to tell a story that goes against all these pre@@ conceived no@@ tions .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re not doing films for the elite and the people in their glass houses .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s all about the foreign movies .
move it .
the nigerian filmmakers really , really , are doing what they like .
difficult , eh ? it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s meaningless .
and we know that there are more .
z@@ ambi@@ a-@@ born filmmaker franco sa@@ c@@ chi tours us through nol@@ lywood , nigeria &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s booming film industry . guer@@ ri@@ lla film@@ making and brilliance under pressure from crews that can shoot a full-@@ length feature in a week .
we were talking about the rap@@ ture ? it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s coming .
you know , we have to go through that .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s about rolling a ball and picking up as many objects as you can in a fin@@ ite amount of time and hopefully you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll be able to make it into a planet .
so we have portal because you shoot walls in order to create new spaces .
so time , space , aesthetics , and then , most important , behavior .
so in a way , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re showing a manifest@@ ation of something that is truly important and that is part of our identity but that nobody can have .
i was concerned about making a place for the study of law .
i did this building in japan .
we made the drawings of the fish and the scales .
he was a souven@@ ir sal@@ esman who always wanted to be a painter , and i was frankie p. toronto .
and it seemed to work as a way to put he and i together .
and herman miller has this philosophy of having a place -- a people place .
and so then he put two bridges -- this all happened on the fax , going back and forth over a couple of weeks &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; period .
they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve been building it so long i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t remember where it is .
we used it at loy@@ ola on the chapel , and it didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t work .
this is a piece of property in brent@@ wood .
and then you enter into the living room and then so on .
and you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re looking at it from the offices and you create a kind of interaction between these pieces .
if any of you guys have any ideas for it , please contact me .
and i tried to -- there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a nick grim@@ shaw building over here , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s an oldenburg sculpture over here -- i tried to make a relationship urban@@ i@@ stically .
the acou@@ sti@@ cian in the competition gave us criteria , which led to this com@@ part@@ ment@@ alized scheme , which we found out after the competition would not work at all .
and this is a te@@ apo@@ t i designed for aless@@ i .
it didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t work .
and so this is what they do .
so you start with the bag@@ asse , and then you take a very simple kil@@ n that you can make out of a waste fifty five-@@ gallon oil drum .
so we wanted to try to find a way to make a stronger bri@@ quette so that we could compete with wood charcoal in the markets in haiti .
but this is one of the incredibly rare situations where you also have economic benefits .
and we need to think about how we can do that effectively .
and this bone is pepper@@ ed , as you can see , with the light shining through the skull with cav@@ ities , the sin@@ uses , which warm and moi@@ sten the air we breathe .
as you can see , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s blocking her vision .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s exactly what people used to say to sue .
he maintained a calm in@@ sou@@ ci@@ ance .
because you might say , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; well , this type of surgery might be regarded as cosmetic . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and beauty doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t equ@@ ate to goodness , and certainly doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t equ@@ ate to cont@@ ent@@ ment .
&@@ quo@@ t@@ ; i want to look like this . this is how i looked before . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
so the better news is the future &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s almost here -- and the future is tissue engineering .
how do we really change children &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s relationship to food ?
sevent@@ y percent of all antibiotics consumed in america is consumed in animal hus@@ ban@@ dry .
it is about what we feed them .
why can we have 29-@@ cent big gul@@ ps and 99-@@ cent double burgers ?
we really need to change this whole paradig@@ m with kids and food .
they do ta@@ stings of these ingredients in the gardening classes .
one of the things i do a lot is public-@@ private partnerships .

so we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re spending less than a dollar , ok , on lunch .
and he pointed up to the sky , and he said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; look , do you see that ?
when i go to a philosopher &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s party and they ask me what i work on and i say , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; consciousness , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; their eyes don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t gla@@ ze over -- their lips cur@@ l into a snar@@ l .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the order of the day here .
this means that a lot of people are just left completely dissatis@@ fied and incre@@ dul@@ ous when i attempt to explain consciousness .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m working with a young computer-@@ anim@@ ator document@@ arian named nick de@@ amer , and this is a little demo that he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s done for me , part of a larger project some of you may be interested in .
and i started across the hall in north carolina , because i thought it was probably a can@@ al@@ etto , and would have all that in detail .
how many of you did it by rotating the one on the left in your mind &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s eye , to see if it matched up with the one on the right ?
if you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re seeing it as a cube floating in front of some circles , some black circles , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s another way of seeing it .
and keep going , until the subject presses the button , saying , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; i see the change . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
thanks very much for your attention .
they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re basically attempts at figuring out what people should do instead of rush hour car driving .

well he also saw that when health care turns to medical care because of a more serious disease , the key thing that holds us back is access to information .
the question was , where from ?
where does medical ability end and start ?
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s really serious .

the opportunity we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to look to is a genuine basis for optimism about the bottom billion , and that is the commodity bo@@ oms .

it turns out that electoral competition is the thing that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s doing the damage with democracy , whereas strong checks and balances make resource bo@@ oms good .

so the contributions of culture -- if culture changes us , as indeed it does , it changes us by changing our brains .
well , consider by analo@@ gy , the concept of physical health .
the fact that there are exceptions here does not change that at all .
this is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue .
whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded .
sam harris : yeah , well i think i tried to bro@@ ach this in a sentence , watching the clock ticking , but the question is : what is voluntary in a context where men have certain expectations , and you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re guaranteed to be treated in a certain way if you don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t veil yourself ?

the third thing on my check@@ list is relations with neighboring friendly societies that may prop up a society . and if that friendly support is pulled away , that may make a society more likely to collapse . in the case of the green@@ land nor@@ se , they had trade with the mother country -- norway -- and that trade dwind@@ led : partly because norway got weaker , partly because of sea ice between green@@ land and norway .
so , some societies , for subtle environmental reasons , are more fragile than others . and then finally , another gener@@ alization . i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m now teaching a course at ucla , to ucla under@@ graduates , on these collapses of societies . what really bugs my ucla undergraduate students is , how on earth did these societies not see what they were doing ?
instead , all the major threats facing us today are problems entirely of our own making . and since we made the problems , we can also solve the problems . that then means that it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s entirely in our power to deal with these problems .
well we know that that was not a cheap war .
what are you eating ?
how are we going to feed this world ?
this has happened in the netherlands in the 1990s during the classical sw@@ ine fever outbreak .
one kilo@@ gram of gras@@ shoppers has the same amount of calories as 10 hot dogs , or six big mac@@ s .
so why are we not eating insects yet ?
look at them first . look at them first .
that means we get our new hips for free .
in fact , when we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re traveling abroad , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s how we identify fellow canadians .

you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re using your built-in dynamics , the physics of your body , just like a pen@@ du@@ lum .

it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a story of public education and of rural communities and of what design might do to improve both .
the biggest employer is the purdue chicken processing plant .

it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the physical construction of improved spaces and materials and experiences for teachers and students .
so in many cases this is not so much about making change as it is creating the conditions under which change is possible and the incentive to want to make change , which is easier said than done in rural communities and in insi@@ de-@@ the-@@ box education systems in rural communities .
and during that time , they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re doing everything from going out and doing eth@@ no@@ graphic research and doing the nee@@ d-@@ finding , coming back into the studio , doing the brain@@ storming and design visu@@ alization to come up with concepts that might work , and then moving into the shop and actually testing them , building them , proto@@ typing them , figuring out if they are going to work and refining that .
but we feel like this could work in other places .
generally , what you see in green is not deser@@ ti@@ fying , and what you see in brown is , and these are by far the greatest areas of the earth .

it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s now two years that you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve been running ?

and she came into town and she rushed around and she said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; i have to buy some new shoes ! &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
now this is obviously a powerful , some might say dangerously powerful , insight .
some people think this number &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a little bit large , but copyright mathemati@@ cians who are media lobby experts are merely surprised that it doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t get compounded for inflation every year .
see , in the real world math isn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t necessarily done by mathemati@@ cians .
once you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve done that , then there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the comput@@ ation step .
i estimated that , just today , across the world , we spent about 106 average world life@@ times teaching people how to calculate by hand .
so my usual question is , what do you mean by &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; basics ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t think so .
but there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a fantastic way to do that in the modern world .
and of course , it turns into a circle .
and you know if you walk across a ch@@ asm , you end up making it worse than if you didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t start at all -- bigger disaster .
its le@@ ash had been tied to the chair as her master went in for coffee , and she was just persistent in her efforts to greet me , perhaps get a scratch behind the ear .

as i say in my book , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m jewish in the same way the olive garden is italian .

so , i was able to stone one adul@@ terer .
but this one is -- the bible says that you cannot touch women during certain times of the month , and more than that , you cannot sit on a seat where a menstru@@ ating woman has sat .
this was one of the great things about my year , doing the sab@@ bath , because i am a work@@ ah@@ olic , so having this one day where you cannot work , it really , that changed my life .
and they said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; we don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t know , but it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s just rituals that give us meaning . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
so , anyway , thank you so much for letting me speak .
the problem , as we see it , has to do with a single , simple word : &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; space , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; or a single , simple phrase : &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; real world ge@@ ome@@ try . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
but if you displayed that on a cr@@ t or flat panel display , it would be meaningless to hold up an arbitrary object , a real world object in that .
so this led full circle , in a strange way , to build these ideas into what we believe is the necessary future of human machine interface : the spati@@ al operating environment , we call it .

there are two kinds of errors people make when trying to decide what the right thing is to do , and those are errors in estimating the odds that they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to succeed , and errors in estimating the value of their own success .

but is there a rational fear that actually , the reason we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re frightened about this is because we think that the big one is to come ?
so , you know , when a school bus is blown up and we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve never seen this before , our general tendency is to orient towards that which is new and novel is activated .

that can be a big contribution .
the phrase &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; art is whatever &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; expresses the current inclusi@@ veness that sur@@ rounds art-@@ making -- a sort of &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; it ain &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t what you do , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the way that you do it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; notion .
so by and large , they are good for our survival .
the philosopher martha nuss@@ baum points this out in this quote : &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; thus throughout history , certain disgust properties -- sli@@ min@@ ess , bad smell , stick@@ iness , deca@@ y , foul@@ ness -- have been repeatedly and mono@@ ton@@ ously been associated with ...
when we actually looked at not just self-@@ reported political orientation , but voting behavior , we were able to look geographi@@ cally across the nation . what we found was that in regions in which people reported high levels of disgust sensitivity , mccain got more votes .
it makes less sense that an emotion that was built to prevent me from inge@@ sting poison should predict who i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to vote for in the upcoming presidential election .

marcus : and how many soldiers have you recruited to fight this war with you ?

or we can zoom out to the table of contents , and the video keeps playing .
all right . mike , thanks so much .
a lot of us work for people ; we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re in the hands of other people .
so where do we go now ?
september 11 generated some interest in moving it over to ground zero , and i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m totally against that .
i tried to understand that language as a beginning , as a place to jump off , and there was so much of it being done by spe@@ c builders and it was tri@@ vi@@ alized so much that it wasn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t ...
fg : i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t know .
i was so proud .
and i think that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve always been interested in , is that -- which is a personal kind of expression .
it was a table as long as this carpet and the harbor commissioner was here , and i was here , and my guys .
frank ge@@ hr@@ y : a master architect asks , now what ?
totally transformed by man .
these things that i photographed -- this tire pile here had 45 million tires in it . it was the largest one .
and for me china -- i started photograph@@ ing it four years ago , and china truly is a question of sustainability in my mind , not to mention that china , as well , has a great effect on the industries that i grew up around .
this is wu@@ shan , one of the largest cities that was relocated .
what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s also happening in shanghai is -- china is changing because this wouldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t have happened five years ago , for instance . this is a hol@@ d@@ out .
and i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m sure there are people here who probably know better than i do about effici@@ encies , but i can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t imagine that every apartment having its own air conditioner is a very efficient way to cool a building on this scale .
they were just wound up doing these things all day long , until the manager had to , with a stern voice , say , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; okay , everybody freeze . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
this was one of the biggest factories i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve ever seen .
and as much as there are great things around the corner -- and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s palpable in this room -- of all of the things that are just about to break that can solve so many problems , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m really hoping that those things will spread around the world and will start to have a positive effect .
and anything that you can do to promote that would be fantastic .
and the scale of my work , and the kinds of ideas i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m playing with -- when i first saw an ima@@ x film , i almost immediately thought , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a real reson@@ ance between what i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m trying to do and the scale of what i try to do as a photographer . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and the reason we see mines is because there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a lot of valuable raw materials that went into making all of this stuff in the first place .
plastics have over@@ lapping den@@ si@@ ties over a very narrow range .
and we eventually broke the code .
we take out the things that aren &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t plastics , such as the metals they missed , car@@ pe@@ ting , foam , rubber , wood , glass , paper , you name it .
and finally , i hope you agree with me to change that last toddler rule just a little bit to : &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; if it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s broken , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s my stuff . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
you know , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re the smar@@ test thing out there , why can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t we figure this out ?
you know , so you can take comfort in the fact that this guy up here is a really really distant , but albeit evolutionary , relative .
but this is the unit of currency that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve taught our monkeys at yale to actually use with humans , to actually buy different pieces of food .
well , you might actually imagine them to do all the kinds of smart things that humans do when they start ex@@ changing money with each other .
the more surprising thing was that when we collaborated with economists to actually look at the monkeys &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; data using economic tools , they basically matched , not just qualit@@ atively , but quant@@ it@@ atively with what we saw humans doing in a real market .
your other option is a bit safe . your just going to get some money for sure .
so what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s going on ?
the guy on the left is a safe bonus .
again , same choice ; they can play it safe for always getting two grapes every single time , or they can take a risky bet and choose between one and three .
well , one thing we know is that they tend to be really hard to overcome .
thank you .
and i feel that way because three billion people in the world today , over the next 20 years , will need a new home .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the change .
the engineering is , tru@@ th@@ fully , the easy part of this .
bomb blast curtains covered my windows .
think about it : what other business do you know , what other sector of the economy , and especially one as big as the public sector , that doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t seek to rein@@ vent its business model on a regular basis ?
no one is better at this activity of actually getting us to engage in delivering services , sometimes where none exist , than u@@ shah@@ i@@ di .
let me be very clear , and perhaps controversial , that open government is not about transparent government .
we don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t have words , really , to describe it yet .
in fact , she indicated that if we would do that , not only would we have the joy of receiving the gratitude from the members of the extended family , but she said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; even god will smile , and when god smiles , there is peace , and justice , and joy . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and , like chief seattle said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; we did not spin the web of life .

the vietnam protests , the commemor@@ ation of all that died in the pandemic of aids , the march for women &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s reproductive rights , right up until almost the present .
one re@@ deem@@ ing feature is it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s lifted up off the ground and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s got this void , and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s got an empty core kind of in the spirit and that facade very much corporate and federal style .
and it has to be free .

sometimes you gotta lose to win .
don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t even know the day i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll ever return .
and one thing that shocked me is one day they brought an arab musician to come and entertain the soldiers .
but that moved me .
well now , my time is going , so i want to sing a song .
he never knew his father very well , because his father left his mom while she was pregnant with him .
some of these lawyers were successful ; they managed to get new trials for their clients .
all that i want to tell you is that the reason that this has happened is because death penalty lawyers have understood that the earlier you intervene in a case , the greater the likelihood that you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to save your client &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s life .
what we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re talking about today is just as complicated .
now , it was logisti@@ cally difficult .
i hope there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s one thing you all won &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t forget : in between the time you arrived here this morning and the time we break for lunch , there are going to be four homicides in the united states .

september 10 is not your birthday . it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s october 10 . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; and i said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; what ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
now , i was raised in the pacific northwest , around a lot of church of lat@@ ter-@@ day saints people and , you know , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve worked with them and even dated them , but i never really knew the doctrine or what they said to people when they were out on a mission , and i guess i was , sort of , curious , so i said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; well , please , come in . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; and they looked really happy , because i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t think this happens to them all that often .
i said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; what happened to the la@@ man@@ ites ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
what if you had a nose job and you liked it ?
we have focused on the problems .
i believe , if kennedy was alive today , he would be asking statisti@@ cians such as myself to go out and find out what makes life worthwhile .
when it has a scarce resource that it wants to turn into a desirable outcome , it thinks in terms of efficiency .
the country on its own up at the top is a place i haven &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t been to .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s one way of looking at it .
and that means we have to really increase efficiency even more .
do you invest the time with your loved ones that you could do , and energy ?
they don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t need a lot of material goods to be satisfied .
what turned out to determine whether someone would stop and help a stranger in need was how much of a hurry they thought they were in -- were they feeling they were late , or were they absorbed in what they were going to talk about .
now this is a -- it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a little test i encourage you to try out at a party .
right now , as bill mc@@ don@@ ough has pointed out , the objects that we buy and use have hidden consequences .
the moment i stopped , half a dozen other people immediately rin@@ ged the same guy .
i realized then that i , who thought i had complete control of my life , had control of only three things : my thought , my mind -- the images that these thoughts created -- and the action that derived from it .
i needed something to go that extra mile , and i found it in that metaphor which i had learned from my mother when i was four .

but in general it was difficult -- it was really difficult to explain what the web was like .
what do you mean , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; data &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; ? what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the difference -- documents , data ?
data is relationships .
let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s think about data for a bit .
audience : raw .
now if i go on like this , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll think that all the data comes from huge institutions and has nothing to do with you .
you may not have lots of data which you have yourself to put on there but you know to demand it .
all together , they achieved these results : increased the number of people on anti-@@ retro@@ vir@@ als , life-saving anti-@@ aids drugs ; nearly hal@@ ved deaths from malaria ; vaccinated so many that 5.4 million lives will be saved .
now here , we see the role for an unprecedented coalition of social media giants and up@@ starts , tele@@ coms companies , reality tv show formats , gaming companies , tele@@ coms , all of them together in kind of their &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; we are the world &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; moment .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s getting near zero .
thank you , thank you .
and he said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; oh , i teach at a college of arts .
so i just thought , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to capture thum@@ b@@ print , footprint , or whatever traces we leave as humans . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
if we ask einstein , he would say , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; whether the cow crossed the road , or the road moved underneath the cow , depends on your frame of reference . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;

and this was collected by an@@ ap@@ um -- which is like , finally in the end , he will not have anything , because it will evapor@@ ate .
this gave me a greater faith .
you can see the detail .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m a little bit of an amateur historian , so i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve spent some time going back , trying to see the first mention of this kind of thing . and the best , earliest quote that i could find was one from david livingstone , writing in the 18@@ 50s about how the railroad , the steam ship , and the telegraph were integr@@ ating east africa perfectly with the rest of the world .
so it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s very clear that if you look at these numbers or all the other numbers that i talk about in my book , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; world 3.0 , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re very , very far from the no-@@ border effect benchmark , which would im@@ ply internation@@ alization levels of the order of 85 , 90 , 95 percent .
the perspective was , here is this poor professor .
think of france and the current debate about immigration .
at the same time , i was thinking , well , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s lots of possibility here to produce contemporary products , away from the ethnic , a little bit more contemporary .
but if we re@@ arrange this formula quickly , we can get to acceleration equals force over mass , which means that for a larger parti@@ cle -- a larger mass -- it requires more force to change its direction .
the marketing is -- the message for marketing is -- that try to measure what consumers actually do , rather than what they say they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll do or anticipate they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll do .
your brand starts being disper@@ sed , it gets more chaotic .
and the third string is pretty innovative .
so , for example , you can be a pitcher or a catcher , and that correspon@@ ds to whether you perform a sexual act or receive a sexual act .
can you imagine saying to your coach , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; u@@ h , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m not really feeling it today , i think i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll sit this game out . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
&@@ quo@@ t@@ ; well , maybe we can go half and half . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and sometimes that can be different amounts over different times or with different people or on different days .
&@@ quo@@ t@@ ; what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; tis to love ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; shakespeare said .

i was just stag@@ gered by it .
and i think that the sex drive evolved to get you out there , looking for a whole range of partners .
in short , they are acquiring the status that they had a million years ago , 10,000 years ago , 100,000 years ago .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s one of many , many characteristics that women have that they will bring into the job market .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re also returning to an ancient form of marriage equality .
this is why you can feel such a sense of cosmic union with somebody after you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve made love to them .
dop@@ amine is associated with romantic love .

and everybody there agreed this woman was very sick and she needed to be in the hospital .
i actually just as@@ s@@ med the path@@ ologi@@ c sequence of events was settled science .
in fact , what if it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a symptom of a much deeper problem , the tip of a pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al iceberg ?
now i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t know why , but it might be because , in their case , their cells haven &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t actually figured out the right thing to do with that excess energy .

so when i was born , i guess you could say expectations were kind of high for me .
i mean , i think most people in the industry understand that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got to get on with it .
frankly , four billion clean cars on the road are still four billion cars , and a traffic jam with no emissions is still a traffic jam .
now shared car services are also spring@@ ing up around the world , and these efforts , i think , are great .
we need that same kind of passion and energy to attack global gri@@ d@@ lock .
charlie led@@ better , yesterday , i thought , talked very articul@@ ately about this need to bring consumers , to bring people into the process of creating things .
so they snapped into action .
george de me@@ stral -- this is not bugs all over a birken@@ stock -- was walking his dog in a field and got covered in bur@@ rs , sort of little pri@@ ck@@ ly things , and from that came vel@@ cro .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s been all about these kind of thou@@ ght@@ less things that people do , which have huge intention and huge opportunity .
i talk about un@@ thinking situations all the time .
so , again , we were asked to design a water pump for a company called ap@@ prote@@ c , in kenya .
contagious is a good word .
and in two hours , after their backs were broke , they were changed .
they are skating . they are doing street plays .
k first time , a rally and a street play in a rural school -- un@@ heard of -- to tell their parents why literacy is important .
so , today who is it going to take to spread the infection from 100,000 children to the 200 million children in india ?
and interestingly , as i think back , they were the first true environmentalists .
unfortunately , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not the answer .
if i pull back from that global picture , and i look at the impli@@ cation over a similar period of time in terms of the technology -- which , as a tool , is a tool for designers , and i cite our own experience as a company , and i just illustrate that by a small selection of projects -- then how do you measure that change of technology ?
round about that design period leading up to this building , i did a sketch , which we pulled out of the archive recently .
so for example , we would put models under an artificial sky .
so really , re@@ trans@@ lating that technology and developing something which was so clean , it was virtually pollu@@ tion-@@ free .
so there has been a project which resc@@ ues the dead sea by creating a pipeline , a pipe , sometimes above the surface , sometimes buried , that will re@@ dress that , and will feed from the gulf of aq@@ aba into the dead sea .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s more than one device , you know , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s renewable .
and here you can see how they really crafted a beautiful design process with physical models , with quantitative , as well as qualit@@ ative , methods to come to a final solution that is truly integrated and completely holistic with the architecture .
to me it is something from theatre , and i will get back to that a little bit later .
so light is , of course , for social interaction also -- to create relationships with all the features around us .
and we can actually leave it out where it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not needed at all and where we can preserve darkness .
can we be more gentle with light ?
in architecture , it works just the same .
is it that i write very well ?

if this woman has to carry water on her head for miles and miles and miles , you cannot be celebrating that .
they could be creative in terms of education , they may be creative in terms of culture , they may be creative in terms of institutions ; but a lot of our work is in the field of technological creativity , the innovations , either in terms of contemporary innovations , or in terms of traditional knowledge .
obviously she &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s an artist ; she &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a creative person .

we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve been working on this , actually , as an alternative energy source , starting way back with johnson &@@ amp@@ ; amp ; johnson , to run an i@@ bot , because the best batteries you could get -- 10 watt-@@ hours per kilo@@ gram in lead , 20 watt-@@ hours per kilo@@ gram nick@@ el-@@ c@@ admi@@ um , 40 watt-@@ hours per kilo@@ gram in nick@@ el-@@ metal hy@@ dri@@ de , 60 watt-@@ hours per kilo@@ gram in lithium , 8,@@ 750 watt-@@ hours of energy in every kilo@@ gram of pro@@ pan@@ e or gasoline -- which is why nobody drives electric cars .

however , while it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s easier to think of us , the citizens , the police , the army , as the good guys , and them , the nar@@ cos , the car@@ tel@@ es , as the bad guys , if you think about it , the latter are only providing a service to the former .
but this is the result of a very careful branding and business strategy .
they have actually retained access to the profitable drug trade , but the way they do it is , because they control all of mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ á@@ n , and they control the port of l@@ á@@ zar@@ o c@@ á@@ r@@ den@@ as , they leverage that to , for example , trade copper from mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ á@@ n that is legally created and legally extracted with illegal ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine from china which is a critical precur@@ sor for meth@@ amphetam@@ ines that they produce , and then they have partnerships with larger organizations like the sin@@ alo@@ a federation that place their products in the u.s .
and so to me the question is not whether these dynamics will continue the way they have .
and then it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s time to do it again . last year .
the next phase it hit was displacement .
here &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s another technology that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s approaching a critical price .
you can have regenerative bra@@ king ; you can have drive-@@ by-@@ wire ; you can have repla@@ ceable body shapes -- it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a little thing that starts with a hybrid , but it can lead to a whole new era of the car .
and what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s interesting is that it was just 1990 when it was more than two dollars a minute .
they use mo@@ but@@ u as metaphor .
i want to share one story about an innovation called drip irrigation .
and so we met dr. son@@ o khan@@ gh@@ ar@@ ani in pakistan .

you have my friend , who has a blog on digital -- on p@@ dr@@ s , personal recor@@ ders .

i wrote this one , and i put this up because of einstein today .
and you see this post .
i showed a norman rock@@ well painting before , and this one i grew up with , looking at constantly .
i put the bad pictures up too , because there are bad pictures .
they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re the largest of the tun@@ as , the second-largest fish in the sea -- bon@@ y fish .
the european population and north african -- the eastern blu@@ ef@@ in tuna -- is fi@@ shed at tremendous levels : 50,000 tons over the last decade almost every year .
we basically are taking the same satellite phone parts , or the same parts that are in your computer , chips .
now , the activities from the lab have taught us now how to go out in the open ocean .
there are two villages , harris and more@@ head city , every winter for over a decade , held a party called tag-@@ a-@@ giant , and together , fi@@ shers worked with us to tag 800 to 900 fish .
these become forth@@ right in places we need to protect .
the tuna team from top@@ p has done the unthinkable : three teams tagged 1,700 tun@@ as , blu@@ ef@@ in , yellow@@ fin and al@@ bac@@ ore all at the same time -- carefully rehear@@ sed tag@@ ging programs in which we go out , pick up juvenile tun@@ as , put in the tags that actually have the sensors , stick out the tuna and then let them go .
we did this with the great turtle race -- tagged turtles , brought in four million hits .

now the interesting thing is , reputation is the socio@@ economic lu@@ bri@@ cant that makes collaborative consumption work and scale , but the sources it will be generated from , and its applications , are far bigger than this space alone .
there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s been an explosion of collaborative consumption -- we@@ b-@@ powered sharing of cars , apartments , skills . rachel bo@@ tsman explores the currency that makes systems like airbnb and tas@@ kra@@ bb@@ it work : trust , influence , and what she calls &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; reputation capital . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
now i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to show you what that does to our societies .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s simply the proportion of the population who agree most people can be trusted .
but it goes from about 40 to 400 people in prison .
the position of women , how closely they keep to the nuclear family , are on opposite ends of the poles in terms of the rich developed world .
but i should say a few words about what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s going on .
and of course , others using more sophisticated methods in the literature have controlled for poverty and education and so on .
one of the key areas we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve been working on recently is medical devices , and while it may not be obvious that medical devices have something in common with iraq &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s electricity grid then , there are some common@@ alities .

notice anything about it ?
the industry average is about 65 percent .
you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got to pay for your soap , your de@@ odor@@ ant , tooth@@ brush , tooth@@ paste , all of it .
the best thing we can do is figure out ways to nur@@ ture the entrepreneurial spirit and the tremendous un@@ tapped potential in our prisons , because if we don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t , they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re not going to learn any new skills that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s going to help them , and they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll be right back .
second of all , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s really beautifully balanced : it holds well , it feels well .
now , the weird thing is google lies , because if i type &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; design and emotion , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; it says , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; you don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t need the &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; and . &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; we do it anyway . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
now some people can -- circus workers , steel workers .
no big deal .
and behavioral design is all about feeling in control , which includes us@@ ability , understanding -- but also the feel and heft .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s kind of neat . what a wonderful design .
and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s nice about emotion .
but it was quite obvious , quite clear , that for this particular route that i had taken , the remo@@ ter the school was , the worse its results seemed to be .
anyway , so i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m proposing that an alternative primary education , whatever alternative you want , is required where schools don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t exist , where schools are not good enough , where teachers are not available or where teachers are not good enough , for whatever reason .
so he figured that out . it took him over two minutes to figure out that he was doing things to the television .
so they said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; well , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve left this machine which talks only in english , so we had to learn english . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
what could they learn to do ?
a typical example being , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; sometimes it is necessary to tell lies . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
thank you .
and i , one day , i announced this to my parents -- and my father denies this story to this day -- i said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; daddy , i want to be a diplomat . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and anyway , my tour -- it was kind of a very exciting time .
secondly , the government had ignored all available alternatives to war , which in some ways was a more discredi@@ table thing still .
my pension was in it .
why don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t you advise their government on their diplomacy ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and one thing led to another , and i ended up having a desk in ? what if ! in new york , when i started independent diplomat .
what this means is it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s no longer good enough to say that international relations , or global affairs , or chaos in somalia , or what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s going on in bur@@ ma is none of your business , and that you can leave it to governments to get on with .
and of course , everybody got it . everybody went , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; yes , of course , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re absolutely right .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s that broken experience on the web .
so where this comes into play and why this is important is i head up a technology incu@@ bat@@ or , and we had eight startups sitting around there .
so most everyone watches tv .
animals might love to play , but they don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t love to watch .
as we start , you see in 1960 inspiration is holding steady .
look at this green spike in 1966 to a bell@@ we@@ ther show .
glamorous and rich .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s all great , right ?
and then she clarified . she said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; you know what , i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t mean that it su@@ cks . it means that i didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t understand a word of it .
because , you see , dna is like a blueprint that tells living things what to make .
it kills me . i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m not kid@@ ding .
or even worse , science education is becoming like that guy who always says , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; actually . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s still so much work left to be done , though , and if you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re involved with science in any way i urge you to join me .
but sometimes it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s as though a door@@ way appears from out of nowhere and it opens onto a staircase .
but here &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the weir@@ dest place of all : war .
dur@@ k@@ heim called this level the level of the sacred because he believed that the function of religion was to unite people into a group , into a moral community .
he said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; if the one tribe included a great number of courageous , sympathetic and faithful members who are always ready to aid and defend each other , this tribe would succeed better and con@@ quer the other . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and as you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll see in this simulation , as they interact they gain points , as it were , they grow , and when they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve doubled in size , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll see them split , and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s how they re@@ produce and the population grows .
it happened again about 120 or a 140 million years ago when some solitary wasps began creating little simple , pri@@ mit@@ i@@ ve ne@@ sts , or hi@@ ves .
i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t mean that we evolved to join gigantic organized religions .
and that gives me hope because people are not purely selfish .
so i realized then that i wanted to go out on a journey and see what guys were creating for themselves now .
here is another pretty typical scene . this is a suburban las vegas neighborhood .
and the thing you really hope for is occasionally they burn up , which we won &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t see tonight . so .
and this graffiti artist has come along , made this sign a little bit better , and then moved on .
and the more you try to think about it , the further the answer gets from you , and the minute you stop thinking about it , your intu@@ ition gives you that answer , in a sense .
that was it . that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s all he saw as the options . and not too far off .
and it was purpo@@ sely done to look fairly serious .
this is how the ad ran throughout the world ; germany made one slight change in the ad .
the coveted right-@@ hand page was not given up to the whole issue .
what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s next ? what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s next is going to be people .
and if you would , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got a great job .
something , again , that went back to something more fundamental .
this is another version of that . this is a sea dragon , and the one on the bottom , the blue one , is a juvenile that has not yet swal@@ lowed the acid , has not yet taken in the brow@@ n-@@ green algae pond sc@@ um into its body to give it energy .
they never touch the inner matter . there is more and more co-@@ evolution .
and he has decided to treat them as if they were tri@@ lo@@ bites , or sna@@ ils , and to do a mor@@ p@@ holo@@ gical analysis , and try to deri@@ ve their gene@@ alo@@ gical history over time .
so we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve all heard about the ami@@ sh giving up cars .
and so a hammer , when we grab a hammer , that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re grabbing .
and if you play that well , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll have other people involved , so even that game extends and continues even when you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re gone .
and while a student at hawaii , i worked at the wai@@ ki@@ ki aquarium .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s been a good ride .
so we created a way to find out , and i got my first look at that famous be@@ ak in action .
and over the tops of them is 3,000 to 4,000 meters of water creating enormous pressure , forcing water down through the cracks toward the center of the earth , until it hits a mag@@ ma chamber where it becomes super@@ heated and super@@ saturated with minerals , rever@@ ses its flow and starts shooting back to the surface and is ejected out of the earth like a gey@@ ser at yellowstone .
and that e@@ ph@@ emer@@ al nature of the hydro@@ thermal vent community isn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t really different from some of the areas that i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve seen in 35 years of traveling around , making films .
and a small group of thoughtful people changed that bay .
now , sylvia &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s ted prize wish was to be@@ see@@ ch us to do anything we could , everything we could , to set aside not pin pri@@ cks , but significant expan@@ ses of the ocean for preservation , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; hope spots , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; she calls them .
now the rules that i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m talking about are constantly being monitored by the culture .
and then i thought -- in my 40s i started thinking , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; well , why don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t i do something ?
here &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s some numbers .
you could drop an atom bomb on a city , and 30 years later it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s surviving .
so let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s first talk about biology .
so is london a scaled up birmingham , which is a scaled up brighton , etc . , etc . ?
and we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve looked at everything : more aids cases , flu , etc .
that would be bad for economies and cities .
but you notice , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve cheated , because i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve only gone up to &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; 94 .
right about the time that the internet gets going as an educational tool , i take off from wisconsin and move to kansas , small town kansas , where i had an opportunity to teach in a lovely , small-@@ town , rural kansas school district , where i was teaching my favorite subject , american government .
but what was interesting about this position i found myself in in arizona , was i had this really in a truly public school , and we got to have these moments where we would get these opportunities .
that is the absolute wrong thing to ask , to tell kids to never be wrong .
and when we do another round of this in my class this year , they will do better this time , because learning has to include an amount of failure , because failure is instru@@ ctional in the process .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s simply accelerating the pace at which the body he@@ als itself to a clinically relevant time@@ scale .
41 people who were basically outside of being really sick , paying for the one reti@@ ree who was experiencing debilitating disease .
if a new@@ t can do this kind of thing , why can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t we ?
therefore , if we can find the right cells and im@@ plant them in the body , they may do the healing .
and that material induced the body to switch back on a healing response that it didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t have before .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the cool@@ est stuff .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a great source of stem cells .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s very powerful work .
thank you .
oh , wonderful .
and -- oh , i saw gol@@ die ha@@ wn .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s true . it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s true .
but then on top of that , you know , sarah jones told me we only have 18 minutes .
so , we deserve just as much to be part of the exchange of ideas as everybody else .
my name is pra@@ veen man@@ vi and thank you very much for this opportunity .
my son , he says he is not ready to get married .
so i think maybe ted , you impact people &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s lives in the ways maybe even you don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t realize .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s all , sh@@ ukra@@ n . thank you very much for the opportunity .
but i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m actually here today to tell a story .
i started a couple of businesses that i thought would be the ticket to financial freedom .
but there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s also a lot of people that you don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t know .
and we don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t just want people to see our movies and say , that was fun , and forget about it .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve sent 50,000 dv@@ ds to high school teachers in the u.s .
and finally , an ebay listing for one well-@@ traveled slide show , now obsol@@ ete , museum piece . please contact al gore .
believe it or not , some of us do survive .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s been taped with tape that we even stopped using in the u.@@ k .
equipment that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s obsol@@ ete , equipment that doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t quite work , or it works and you can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t fix it . and there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s nothing wrong with that , so long as we use it and we move on .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what he was doing , pro@@ pping up the bed because the bed simply didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t work .
these are the basic features of my device , or our device .
this was a huge impact on my mind , because i am a woman and i am a mother , and i hadn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t realized that the hiv / aids pandemic was directly affecting women in such a way .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve traveled all over the world in the last two and a half years -- i went to about 12 different countries .
ave@@ li@@ le had the virus , she was born with the virus .
our enemies shall talk themselves to death , and we will fight them with their own confusion .
but over@@ throwing a government is one thing and building a stable democracy is a bit more complicated .
you have a situation where the relationship between government and local social networking companies is creating a situation where , effectively , the empowering potential of these platforms is being constrained because of these relationships between companies and government .
and here in the united kingdom there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s also concern over a law called the digital economy act that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s placing more onus on private intermedi@@ aries to police citizen behavior .
but in the last two decades , it has experienced an unprecedented expansion , now accounting for roughly 15 percent of the world &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s gdp .
the court system wasn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t functioning properly .
the zones of production and distribution tend to lie in the developing world , and they are often threatened by appalling violence and bloodshed .
so i have shown you this to demonstrate how many boats , how many vessels it takes to catch one of these guys .
now , i was taken by inspector brian can@@ tera , of the royal canadian mounted police , to a ca@@ ver@@ nous warehouse east of vancouver to see some of the goods which are regularly confiscated by the rc@@ mp from the smugglers who are sending it , of course , down south to the united states where there is an ins@@ ati@@ able market for b.@@ c. bud , as it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s called , in part because it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s marketed as organic , which of course goes down very well in california .
hooked it up to my laptop , and within about five minutes he had penetr@@ ated the computer security system of a major brazilian bank .
there is no romance involved with gang@@ sters in the 21st century .
everybody knew the answer .
you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve believed it through generations .
all his colleagues said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; this is outrageous .
the only exception is the naked som@@ ali@@ an mol@@ e-@@ rat , which never puts its nose above the surface of the ground .
try to imagine a gorilla performing the same maneu@@ ver , and you can see that , compared with gorilla , we are halfway to being shaped like a fish .
sir david atten@@ borough , he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s come over .
academia says no .
one -- i want to speak as early in the morning as possible .
ah , mark -- ser@@ fa@@ as .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d basically distil@@ led a very difficul@@ t-to-@@ explain and complex philosophy , which i won &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t get into here , because it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a little too deep for all of you , but -- it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s about what makes websites popular , and , you know , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s -- it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s unfortunate that i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t have more time .
and frog mode .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the process of creation that keeps me sort of a bubble and a half above perpetual anxiety in my life , and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s that feeling of being about 80 percent complete on a project -- where you know you still have something to do , but it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not finished , and you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re not starting something -- that really fills my entire life .
i think that the &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; now tied up , tied down , mi@@ stress cruel approaches me , now tied down , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s up . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
you can send them an email .
you may not appreciate the person , you may not appreciate anything else , but maybe you appreciate the fact that they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got a tough gig .
so when you do that , here &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what i can promise : you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to be the 800 pound gorilla in the forest .
and so i went home , and i made a prototype of this hat .
and i thought , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; well , hey !
this very basic shift in my physical orientation helped me shift my perspective in relation to the glacier .
yet we di@@ ther , taking no action to defle@@ ct the asteroid , even though the longer we wait , the more difficult and expensive it becomes . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
our problem and our tragedy is that in these hyper-@@ partisan times , the mere fact that one side says , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; look , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s an asteroid , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; means that the other side &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s going to say , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; hu@@ h ? what ?
it causes them to di@@ stort reality .
so , how warm or cold do you feel about , you know , native americans , or the military , the republican party , the democratic party , all sorts of groups in american life .
but the problem isn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t primarily that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re ele@@ cting bad people to congress .
so here &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s another asteroid .
when americans go to college and marry each other , they have very low divorce rates .
and most surprisingly to me , they sometimes can even see eye to eye on criminal justice .
and this is the conversion of one group of substances into another , either through the production or the absor@@ ption of energy .
so what we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re trying to do is , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re trying to push these technologies towards creating bott@@ om@@ -up construction approaches for architecture , which contrast the current , victorian , top-@@ down methods which impose structure upon matter .
now , this is the very interesting part .
venice is sinking . to save it , rachel armstrong says we need to out@@ grow architecture made of in@@ ert materials and , well , make architecture that grows itself . she proposes a not-@@ quit@@ e-@@ alive material that does its own repairs and se@@ que@@ sters carbon , too .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m scared . tell them to get away . &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; as a young woman , i was in a psychiatric hospital on three different occasions for lengthy periods .
this person is likely to have some form of schizophren@@ ia .
this episode led to my first hospitalization in america .
they wouldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t experience re@@ straints as we would . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
&@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ okay . small . fire on ice . tell them not to kill me .
so let me share some final thoughts .
when i turned 18 , i lost my best friend to a car accident .
second it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s driving itself .
they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re the v@@ eins of the ecosystem , and they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re often empty v@@ eins .
and i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m sure you all know , this has created significant conflicts between the agricultural and environmental communities .
but they have no incentive to do so .
with streams and rivers drying up because of over-@@ usage , rob har@@ mon has implemented an ingen@@ ious market mechanism to bring back the water . farmers and beer companies find their f@@ ates intertw@@ ined in the intriguing centur@@ y-@@ old tale of pri@@ ck@@ ly pe@@ ar creek . &@@ amp@@ ; lt ; em &@@ amp@@ ; gt ; &@@ amp@@ ; lt ; / em &@@ amp@@ ; gt ;
but , yeah .
he &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s by far the happiest man ever measured by science .
and maybe because of that , compassion is organic and widespread compan@@ y-@@ wide .
so what are they ?
so this mutual inspiration promotes collaboration , initiative and creativity .
attention is the basis of all higher cognitive and emotional abilities .
cha@@ de-@@ men@@ g tan : everyday compassion at google
and it took a lot of courage for these defenders to decide that they would begin to stand up and support each other in implementing these laws .
and with that , he successfully organized 68 lawyers who have been systematically taking the cases .
and i was sitting side by side with one of our very courageous lawyers , and said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; how can we get this out ? how can we make sure that this is implemented ?
so i thank you for having the prophe@@ tic imagination to imagine the shaping of a new world with us together , and invite you into this journey with us .
you know when they do home@@ works at home ?
it can be a school of design in jerusalem that tries to find a better way to design gas masks for people , because , as you know , israel deplo@@ ys one gas mask per person including babies .
h@@ ella jon@@ geri@@ us is a person that is able to make a synthe@@ sis that is really quite amazing and also quite hilarious .
so , designers sometimes don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t do things that are immediately functional , but they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re functional to our understanding of issues .
and that makes sense .
but i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going to try and do something different , and try and just close the loop with some of my personal stories , and try and put a face to a lot of the issues that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve been talking about .
and what happened was , because they could afford it sometimes , sometimes not , i got kicked out pretty much every term .
my father , who i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve been talking about , died of aids in 1999 .
how would you look at me ?
so we need to start getting better .
and i can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t emphasize that enough , you know .
you know , they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re not going to change just out of nowhere .
a cousin of mine died of aids , left an or@@ phan , so we said , well , what are we going to do with her ?
and this is just an illustration .
long distance running was not only good for my well-being but it helped me medi@@ tate and dream big .
but for every disaster we had , the marathon found ways to bring people together .
i believe these are the building blocks for future peace .
he was out there in par@@ ol delivering a baby .
she is really the center of the health care system .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m just going to sell these to every clinic in the world .
in may of 2010 , at 35 years old , with a two-year-old at home and my second child on the way , i was diagnosed with a large an@@ eur@@ y@@ sm at the base of my thor@@ ac@@ ic a@@ or@@ ta .
so these are my daughters .
most of the people who lived here either lived in coastal villages , fishing , or were nom@@ ads who ro@@ amed around with the environment trying to find water .
this is probably the skyline that most of you know about doha .
energy is the key factor here . it changed everything .
these risks directly affect the sustainability of this nation and its continuity .
imagine a country with abundant power -- oil and gas , sunshine , wind -- but missing one key essential for life : water . infrastructure engineer fah@@ ad al-@@ at@@ ti@@ ya talks about the unexpected ways that the small middle eastern nation of qatar creates its water supply .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll try where it all started in the middle east , and for so many years we were living with completely the wrong perception of the middle east .
you see nine presidential candidates running against lukashenko .
so there are so many things you can do instead of getting into one place , shouting and showing off in front of the security forces .
it is true that the internet and new media are very useful in making things faster and cheaper .
2011 was a year of extraordinary people-@@ powered resistance , starting with arab spring and spreading across the world . how did this resistance work so well ? sr@@ d@@ ja popo@@ vic lays out the plans , skills and tools each movement needs -- from non@@ violent tactics to a sense of humor . &@@ amp@@ ; lt ; em &@@ amp@@ ; gt ; &@@ amp@@ ; lt ; / em &@@ amp@@ ; gt ;
and i said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; do you remember when we were in college and really wild and kind of dumb ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
the majority of people .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m a fifth generation tex@@ an .
and the purpose is not to walk in and construct a home and live there .
this is like the failure conference .
us .
shame feels the same for men and women , but it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s organized by gender .
you show me a man who can sit with a woman who &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s just had it , she can &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t do it all anymore , and his first response is not , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; i un@@ loaded the dishwasher , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; but he really listens -- because that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s all we need -- i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll show you a guy who &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s done a lot of work .
it is a dream of man@@ kind to fly like a bird .
we have to turn it , go up and go down .
and the irony is that they don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t need to be .
dr. v : see , mcdonald &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s &@@ apo@@ s@@ ; concept is simple .
the effect of this has been that , within the first year , we really had a 40 percent penetration in the market that it served , which is over 50,000 people .
the revenues increase at a higher level , giving us a healthy margin while you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re treating a large number of people for free .
now , how do you make people own the problem , want to do something about it ?
it is a mobile phone-@@ shaped box that has an iron weight inside , which we can move around , and you can feel where it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s heavy .
as humans , we are social , we are empath@@ ic , and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s great .
but even though i had this new@@ found joy and freedom , people &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s reaction completely changed towards me .
for me , this means that they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re seeing the value of difference , the joy it brings when instead of focusing on loss or limit@@ ation , we see and discover the power and joy of seeing the world from exciting new perspectives .
but even more striking than the ferocious power eman@@ ating from that well was the reck@@ lessness with which that power was unleashed -- the car@@ elessness , the lack of planning that characterized the operation from drilling to clean-@@ up .
a range of explanations may be popping into your mind by now , like &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; greed . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m showing it because -- they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re not a sponsor , are they ? -- because , in its own way , this is a cra@@ ss version of our founding story .
ignore those creeping fears that we have finally hit the wall .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a person down there by the wheel .
a new frontier has been found .
b@@ f : ... without a mac@@ arthur grant .
b@@ f : that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s all right , he does that . all right .
dh : wow , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve been working out .
could you just push that ?
b@@ f : ten years to perfect , which you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re about to see .
the design of the body is a whole different thing .
dh : tell them about our bio and stuff .
and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s aw@@ fully windy over there .
because now , to make this twice as difficult , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll ju@@ ggle the seven clubs back ...
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll spend a fortune on it . i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got a better idea .
if you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve ever seen an elec@@ tron micro@@ scope picture , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll see this . this all looks the same , then there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s this bit over here which is incredibly complicated .
now , some people call her the first program@@ mer .
to give you an idea of how slowly , it had about 1@@ k of memory .
i came here to speak about ecology , and i emit@@ ted as much co2 as a frenchman in one year .
according to scientists , in 100 years all the mountain glacier will be gone .
i launched a project named six billion others .
you shouldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t worry about me . dad doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t need to go to work .
it is about the state of the planet .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re only trying to improve our lives .
chromo@@ some one , top left .
world population , pc pla@@ cements , the archive of all the medical literature , moore &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s law , the old way of sequencing , and here &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s all the new stuff .
so unfortunately , this doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t help this woman , but it does have severe , profound if you will , implications to her family .
but the gene that regul@@ ates that down is broken .
thankfully , i was able to answer a , and i say that honestly in case my life insurance agent is listening .
and so imagine one more thing : that that software is able to ask both parties for mutual con@@ s@@ ents , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; would you be willing to meet your third cousin ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
hands it back to me . and we do that again and again .
so why should you care ? bone mar@@ row is a very rich source of adult stem cells .
these cor@@ als can be quite kind of mean , you see , and i have surfing scars to prove that .
and things can happen only if these interactions are perfectly balanced .
finally , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the force of gravity , which inter@@ acts with matter via its mass and spin .
so the electro@@ magnetic and weak forces are described by this pattern of parti@@ cle charges in two-@@ dimensional space .
from this pattern , we already know the parti@@ cle physics of these tiny scales . the way the universe works with these tiny scales is very beautiful .
each point in this pattern correspon@@ ds to a sym@@ me@@ try of this very complex and beautiful shape .
if the l@@ hc finds new particles , but they don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t fit this pattern -- well , that will be very interesting , but bad for this e@@ 8 theory .
but not worrying about rent allowed me to spend my time doing what i love .
i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t know if i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll be able to make this any clearer .
so it remains for me to comment on the ways in which chim@@ pan@@ ze@@ es are so like us , in certain aspects of their behavior .
so it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s pretty sad to find that chim@@ pan@@ ze@@ es , like so many other creatures around the world , are losing their habitats .
they were interested in health ; they were interested in education .
the water -- water is perhaps one of the most crucial issues that we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to face in this century -- and everywhere water is being pollut@@ ed by agricultural , industrial and household chemicals that still are being sprayed around the world , seemingly with the inability to profit from past experience .
see the brick wall as all these problems we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve inflicted on the planet , environmental and social . it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a message of hope .
but -- oh , they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re also working on hiv / aids .
all of these technologies we can use .
thank you .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d go to the supermarket and all of my food is packaged in plastic .
we can cut the stem -- tide the stem of this into our oceans and in doing so , save our oceans , save our planet , save ourselves .
and yes , you also interact using natural gestures , both hands , etc .
my student pran@@ av , who &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s really , like i said , the genius behind this .
but when people learned what her son was accused of , she didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t get that sympathy .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s up to us women , because we are women , because we love our children .
so , ai@@ cha , do you have a couple of words for conclusion ?
well , today , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d like to show you that through thinking differently , the problem has been solved .
so nothing is getting through .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s not dirty enough . let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s just stir that up a little bit .
then , after a few weeks , we set up camps .
so with just eight billion dollars , we can hit the millennium goal &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s target of hal@@ ving the number of people without access to safe drinking water .
and the second is about some new dimension which i want to refer to , which has never quite happened in the way it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s happening now .
the world needs an international forum .
up until now , the united states has been the dominant feature of our world .
take the last financial crisis after the second world war .
diplomacy is about managing the inter@@ relationship of nations .
but now one final thing .
the other 90 percent is dict@@ ated by our lifestyle .
we are program@@ med for something called pro@@ creative success .
but life expectancy in this country is only 78 .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s called the grandmother effect .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s simply a little saying these people say before their meal to remind them to stop eating when their stomach is &@@ #@@ 9@@ 1@@ ; 80 &@@ #@@ 93@@ ; percent full .
they instantly knew why they woke up in the morning .
they take their diet directly from the bible .

dan bu@@ ett@@ ner : how to live to be 100 +
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m curious about how things work and how they are made , but also because i believe we should have a deeper understanding of the components that make up our world , and right now , we don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t know enough about these high-tech composi@@ tes our future will be made of .
electronics kits are very powerful in that they teach us how things work , but the constraints inherent in their design influence the way we learn .
i was a young driver out on the highway , and the car in front of me , i saw the brake lights go on .
and i believe that . i believe that .
if i have a gps and a camera in my car , i have a pretty precise idea of where i am and how fast i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m going .
but i believe it can be done in a way that protects our privacy , just like right now , when i look at your car from the outside , i don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t really know about you .
you can get eight , 10 minutes of weight@@ lessness -- how nasa &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s trained their astronauts for so long .
once he was there , &@@ #@@ 9@@ 1@@ ; we &@@ #@@ 93@@ ; let him go to experience what weight@@ lessness was truly like .
and what i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve tried to do since i had my training as a medical illustr@@ ator -- since i was taught animation by my father , who was a sculp@@ tor and my visual mentor -- i wanted to figure out a way to help people understand truth and beauty in the biological sciences by using animation , by using pictures , by telling stories so that the things that are not necessarily evident to people can be brought forth , and can be taught , and can be understood .
they pass information to each other .
so i packed my cat , my rottweiler and my camping gear into a 1975 che@@ vy van , and drove off into the sunset , having fully failed to realize three critical things .
and i faced a whole new set of challenges .
i started laughing because it got to the point where , was i a writer , or was i a homeless woman ?
becky blan@@ ton : the year i was homeless
we were so much bigger than coca-cola in those days .
uncle gets drunk , doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t use con@@ dom . come back , start again . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and here is this , then , young man called willy bohm who worked for the u@@ said .
so i said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; okay . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
of course i can . and they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ d enjoy it immensely ; i see them standing around right now , everywhere .
90 percent of the funding came from thailand .

so i can see everything that ro@@ mo sees , and i get a robot &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s-@@ eye-@@ view of the world .
thanks , scott .
there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a jewish saying that i love .
however , what matters most -- more than training or luck -- is the heart .
now , how can you have a deep tan and have no wrinkles ?
somehow she manages to keep her seven children alive , and a few months later , she gives birth to premature twins .
feminism has never been sexy , but let me assure you that it never stopped me from flir@@ ting , and i have sel@@ dom suffered from lack of men .
jenny is horrified at what she has done , but then the translator explains that the patient &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s condition has nothing to do with the operation .
does it make sense to participate in the existing world order ?
why not ? it is possible . look around in this room -- all this knowledge , energy , talent and technology .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s something that i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve worked on and a few other people , and it indicates a kind of hierarchy along with some assumptions about how many people stop at different steps and how the steps of thinking are affected a very different theory , a much more popular one , and an older one , due largely to john nash of &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; a beautiful mind &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; fame , is what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s called equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um analysis .
so what you see here is a sub@@ traction of areas in which there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s more brain activity when you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re playing people compared to playing the computer .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s good for them . they make a lot of money .
charles darwin and i and you broke off from the family tree from chim@@ pan@@ ze@@ es about five million years ago .
they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re also very obsessed with status .
colin cam@@ erer : neuro@@ science , game theory , monkeys
and even though there is food that we are producing at great cost , we don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t actually value it .
the answer is what i call &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; ancient food miles . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
and , in fact , if you look at the map of any city built before the industrial age , you can trace food coming in to it .
and this really is the moment when our relationship , both with food and cities , changes completely .
utop@@ ia was actually a word that thomas moore used deliberately .
ste@@ aming piles of hu@@ mus .
we need to realize that the world is also what we eat .
and the religions that should be making a major contribution are instead seen as part of the problem .
i want them to get the media involved because the media are crucial in helping to dissolve some of the stereo@@ typical views we have of other people , which are dividing us from one another .
karen armstrong : let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s revive the golden rule
you de@@ code what you want to fold up into , into a sequence of angles -- so negative 120 , negative 120 , 0 , 0 , 120 , negative 120 -- something like that ; so a sequence of angles , or turns , and you send that sequence through the string .
if you have errors , you can replace a part .
sky@@ lar ti@@ bb@@ its : can we make things that make themselves ?
and obviously there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s been tremendous practical applications associated with this world -- things like the eradi@@ cation of smallpox , the advent of a vaccine against cervical cancer , which we now know is mostly caused by human pap@@ ill@@ om@@ a@@ virus .
that as we explore these strings of a &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s , t &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s , c &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s and g &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s , we may uncover a completely new class of life that , like bei@@ jer@@ in@@ ck , will fundamentally change the way that we think about the nature of biology .
and especially if you regard these two as deep truths to live by and to inform your life decisions , then they seem a little bit to conflict with each other .
now how do we know about an environment that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s so far away , and so different , and so alien , from anything we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re used to ?
we happen to get round to testing , let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s say , newton &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s law of gravity about 300 years ago .
all it takes is for a super@@ nova to go off a few light years away , and we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll all be dead !
the world is buzzing at the moment with plans to force reductions in gas emissions at all costs .
so it has neither the resources , nor the incentives , to hook up many other users .
zoom in on haiti , in outline here .
but den@@ g xia@@ oping instin@@ ctively understood the importance of offering choices to his people .
we also need the choices for people .
let us have a hong kong nearby .
they can get basic utilities like electricity .
let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s have a system where we have ownership of land that is registered in a government office , that people can pledge as collateral .
we just take sea@@ water and we filter it , and we collect different size organisms on different filters , and then take their dna back to our lab in rock@@ ville , where we can sequence a hundred million letters of the genetic code every 24 hours .
i view that these genes are now not only the design components of evolution .
this is a case where the software now builds its own hardware , and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the no@@ tions that we have with biology .
after these genom@@ es are synthe@@ sized , the first step is just transplan@@ ting them into a cell without a genome .
gen@@ omics pioneer craig vent@@ er takes a break from his epic roun@@ d-the-@@ world expedition to talk about the millions of genes his team has discovered so far in its quest to map the ocean &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s biodiversity .
the kids who resisted scored 250 points higher on the sat .
you can be present@@ -@@ he@@ don@@ istic , namely you focus on the jo@@ ys of life , or present@@ -@@ fat@@ alist -- it doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t matter , your life is controlled .
and the idea is so simple , so obvious , but i think the consequences are really profound .
what about resources ? how are we going to feed nine billion people ?
in fact , just studying the rings alone , we stand to learn a lot about the disc@@ s of stars and gas that we call the spiral galaxies .
it can wash the slu@@ dge off high mountain peaks and hills , down into the low@@ lands . so stop and think for a minute .
it was significant for another reason . this is an international mission , and this event was celebrated in europe , in germany , and the celebratory presentations were given in english accents , and american accents , and german accents , and french and italian and dutch accents .
this is an un@@ consolidated ground that is suf@@ fu@@ sed with liquid methane .
my team and i have examined images like this , and like this one , and have thought about the other results from cas@@ sin@@ i .
these leaders are trying to forge a massive national non@@ violent movement to end the occupation and build peace in the region .
reporter : israeli border police were sent to disper@@ se the crowd .
but that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s true for adults too .
julia bach@@ a : pay attention to non@@ violence
this is an invitation to the 70 percent of our un@@ ma@@ pped planet .
so epilep@@ sy patients sometimes need the electrical activity in their brain monitoring .
so if we take some out@@ bound path -- perhaps we park and we wander off -- we know because our own movements , which we can integrate over this path roughly what the heading direction is to go back .
so if this was happening , your memories could start by place cells activ@@ ating each other via these dense inter@@ connections and then re@@ activ@@ ating boundary cells to create the spati@@ al structure of the scene around your view@@ point .
as it turns out , there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a pattern .
they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re beautifully designed , simple to use and user friendly .
a few years ago , gateway came out with flat screen tvs .
you know , sometimes you can give somebody all the facts and figures , and they say , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; i know what all the facts and details say , but it just doesn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t feel right . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
the new york times followed him around everywhere , and everyone was rooting for lang@@ ley .
the next 34 percent are your early majority , your late majority and your la@@ g@@ gar@@ ds .
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a commercial example .
how do you do that ?
leaders hold a position of power or authority , but those who lead inspire us .
the doctors , it seemed , never really had enough time for all the patients , try as they might .
so when i got this email from dr. geiger , i knew i was supposed to be proud to be part of this history .
and we chose to use the prescription for that purpose .
what if we had a waiting room where you don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t just sit when you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re sick , but where you go to get healthy .
and this isn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t just a sort of short-term workforce to connect patients to basic resources , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a next generation healthcare leadership pipeline who &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve spent two , three , four years in the clinic waiting room talking to patients about their most basic health needs .
i believe that we all have a vision for healthcare in this country .
what &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s wrong with this picture ?
the bad news is , this is a semi-@@ sub@@ mer@@ sible run by drug cartels .
you should say , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s odd . i thought i read that this demographic , young men and women in their 20s and 30s , is largely il@@ liter@@ ate in afghanistan . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
when he was fitted , over his extremely my@@ op@@ ic eyes , he suddenly looked up and said , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; mama , ve@@ o el mundo . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;

but these are early incorpor@@ ations of illu@@ sions brought to -- sort of high point with hans hol@@ bein &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; ambassadors . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; and hans hol@@ bein worked for henry viii . this was hung on a wall where you could walk down from the stair and you can see this hidden skull .
u.n. opened their stati@@ stic datab@@ ases , and we have a new version of the software up working as a beta on the net , so you don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t have to download it any longer .
and this was 2007 .
and look here -- compare to the philippines of today .
and now we can see that the rate of change was enormous in japan .
but homage to singapore .
this we can call dollar street .
that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s when research functions in poor societies -- you must really live with the people .
i would say that sub-saharan africa has done best in the world during the last 50 years .
let me first grade what are the most important means .
so the seemingly impossible is possible .
because it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s got all those a &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s lined up i guess .
we can run the score up against anybody , and then get our as@@ ses kicked in the second half -- what they call fourth generation warfare .
and the chinese said to me , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; dr. barnett , you &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re absolutely right .
like sad@@ dam , like mu@@ gabe , like kim jong-@@ il -- people who kill in hundreds of thousands or millions .
do you want to do it , france ?
would you like mu@@ gabe gone ?
we bought one military and we operated another .
can of wh@@ up ass , the networking force .
the rule is going to be this .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve been told by the revolution of military affairs crowd for years , we can do it faster , cheaper , smaller , just as lethal .
sh@@ inse@@ ki was right with the argument .
thanks .
really , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re doing this , basically . really , not very much .
and the reason is , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s been done .
gave a bunch of physical reasons why it wouldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t do a very good compensation .
but then i found out that there were all sorts of papers already published that addressed this topic because it happens already in the natural atmosphere .
maybe another kno@@ b is a kno@@ b for controlling co2 concent@@ rations .
i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ll tell you how big the lever is : the lever is that big .
and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s one of the fundamental reasons that this problem is so hard to talk about , and , in general , i think it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s the underlying reason that it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s been politically unacceptable to talk about this .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to go on a dive to the deep sea , and anyone that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s had that lovely opportunity knows that for about two and half hours on the way down , it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a perfectly positively pit@@ ch-@@ black world .
let &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s take a look at it again . watch the color@@ ation : white on the right , brown on the left .
i thought it was all graphics -- so here it is in reverse .
&@@ quo@@ t@@ ; we don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t care about being happy . we need to live with passion .
i used to be a fan of bach . i used to play it on the guitar , you know .
but there &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s also wicked joy , you can re@@ jo@@ ice in someone &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s suffering .
at the opposite , everyone knows deep within that an act of self@@ less generosity , if from the distance , without anyone knowing anything about it , we could save a child &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s life , make someone happy .
bene@@ vol@@ ence , loving kindness against hatred .
so that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s what those great medi@@ tat@@ ors have been doing .
so , i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve no time to go into all the different scientific results .
what is happiness , and how can we all get some ? bio@@ chemi@@ st turned buddhist monk mat@@ thieu ri@@ card says we can train our minds in habits of well-being , to generate a true sense of seren@@ ity and fulfil@@ l@@ ment .
the environments we are living in , more typically , are like these .
a public place so dismal that the win@@ os don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t even want to go there .
ok .
and we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re not going to cure the problems of the urban by dragging the country into the city , which is what a lot of us are trying to do all the time .
so they take the first one that comes along , often .
we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to have to re-@@ learn what the building blocks of these things are : the street , the block , how to com@@ pose public space that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s both large and small , the courtyard , the civic square and how to really make use of this property .
please go out and do what you can to make this a land full of places that are worth caring about and a nation that will be worth defending .
the deeper you go , the more you run into a conflict with water .
here &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s a clip from a national geographic movie that came out in 1999 .
i mean , i cut through three years of engineering meetings , design and system integration , and introduced dep@@ th@@ x -- deep ph@@ re@@ atic thermal explorer .
the government recently announced plans to return to the moon by 2024 .
so , what if you could get your gas at a 10th the price ?
it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s risky and it &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s going to be one hell of a ride -- better than disney .
100 years after sir ernest shac@@ kle@@ ton wrote these words , i intend to plant an industrial flag on the moon and complete the final piece that will open the space frontier , in our time , for all of us .
so i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve seen life as one long learning process .
i mean , couldn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t you have used the virgin brand for that as well ?
rb : ah , that was quite fun . that was a wonderful car-@@ boat in which -- oh , that car that we -- actually we -- it was a ted@@ ster event there , i think .
and then 24 months from now , people will be able to take a ride into space .
and you inspired an ian m@@ ce@@ wan novel i think with that .
didn &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t -- weren &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t you just terrible at school ?
do you look at the current generation of kids coming up and think they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re too co@@ ddled , they don &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ t know what they &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ ve got , we &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ re going to raise a generation of privileged ...
that is outrageous .
we need to try to encourage people to come up with a way of extra@@ cting carbon out of the earth &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s atmosphere .
i mean , the psychologist erik eri@@ k@@ son says that -- as i understand him and i &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ m a total amateur -- but that during 30s , 40s people are driven by this desire to grow and that &@@ apo@@ s@@ ;@@ s where they get their fulfil@@ l@@ ment .
