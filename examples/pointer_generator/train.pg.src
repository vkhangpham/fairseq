Editor's note: In our Behind the <unk-6> series, CNN <unk-9> share their experiences in covering news and <unk-17> the stories behind the events. Here, <unk-24> O'Brien takes users inside a jail where many of the inmates are mentally ill. An inmate housed on the <unk-44> <unk-45> where many mentally ill inmates are housed in Miami before trial. <unk-57> Florida (CNN) -- The ninth floor of the <unk-66> <unk-67> detention facility is dubbed the <unk-44> <unk-74> Here, inmates with the most severe mental illnesses are <unk-84> until they're ready to appear in court. Most often, they face drug charges or charges of assaulting an officer <unk-104> that Judge Steven <unk-108> says are usually <unk-112> <unk-113> He says the arrests often result from <unk-121> with police. <unk-124> ill people often won't do what they're told when police arrive on the scene -- confrontation seems to <unk-143> their illness and they become more <unk-150> <unk-151> and less likely to follow <unk-157> according to <unk-160> So, they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally <unk-171> but not getting any real help because they're in jail. We toured the jail with <unk-160> He is well known in Miami as an advocate for justice and the mentally ill. Even though we were not exactly welcomed with open arms by the <unk-215> we were given permission to shoot <unk-222> and tour the floor. Go inside the <unk-230> <unk-231> » . At first, it's hard to determine where the people are. The prisoners are wearing <unk-248> <unk-249> Imagine cutting holes for arms and feet in a heavy wool sleeping bag -- that's kind of what they look like. They're designed to keep the mentally ill patients from injuring themselves. That's also why they have no shoes, <unk-289> or <unk-291> <unk-108> says about one-third of all people in <unk-66> county <unk-302> are mentally ill. So, he says, the sheer volume is overwhelming the system, and the result is what we see on the ninth floor. Of course, it is a jail, so it's not supposed to be warm and <unk-341> but the lights <unk-345> the cells are tiny and it's <unk-352> We see two, sometimes three men -- sometimes in the <unk-363> sometimes <unk-365> lying or sitting in their cells. "I am the son of the president. You need to get me out of <unk-386> one man shouts at me. He is absolutely serious, convinced that help is on the way -- if only he could reach the White House. <unk-108> tells me that these <unk-417> will often <unk-420> through the system, occasionally <unk-425> in a mental hospital, only to return to jail to face their charges. It's brutally <unk-441> in his mind, and he has become a strong advocate for changing things in Miami. Over a meal later, we talk about how things got this way for mental patients. <unk-108> says 200 years ago people were considered <unk-480> and they were locked up in <unk-302> even if they had no charges against them. They were just considered unfit to be in society. Over the years, he says, there was some public <unk-514> and the mentally ill were moved out of <unk-302> and into hospitals. But <unk-108> says many of these mental hospitals were so horrible they were shut down. Where did the patients <unk-546> <unk-547> The streets. They <unk-551> in many cases, the <unk-556> he says. They never got treatment. <unk-108> says in <unk-566> there were more than half a million people in state mental hospitals, and today that number has been reduced 90 percent, and 40,000 to 50,000 people are in mental hospitals. The judge says he's working to change this. Starting in 2008, many inmates who would otherwise have been brought to the <unk-44> <unk-619> will instead be sent to a new mental health facility -- the first step on a journey toward long-term treatment, not just punishment. <unk-108> says it's not the complete answer, but it's a start. <unk-108> says the best part is that it's a <unk-663> solution. The patients win, the families are <unk-671> and the state saves money by simply not cycling these prisoners through again and again. And, for <unk-689> justice is <unk-692> E-mail to a friend .

(CNN) -- A former government contract employee was indicted on charges of stealing restricted nuclear <unk-15> materials and putting the United States at risk, the Department of Justice announced Thursday. Sources say the classified materials were taken from the East Tennessee Technology Park. Roy Lynn <unk-45> 67, of <unk-48> County, Tennessee, appeared in federal court in <unk-56> on Thursday. <unk-59> was briefly detained for questioning in the case in January, when authorities first learned of the alleged plot to <unk-79> the <unk-81> government sources told CNN.

"Mr. <unk-59> has <unk-343> fully for the last six <unk-349> said <unk-255> who added that he had traveled to Washington for work on the case.

A <unk-470> is used to filter uranium during the enrichment process, according to nuclear energy officials, but a significant number of barriers are needed to do that job.

A government official with with knowledge of the case said that when authorities learned of <unk-252> alleged intentions six months ago, the FBI and Department of Energy launched a joint investigation.

LONDON, England (CNN) -- Prince Harry led tributes to Diana, Princess of Wales on the 10th anniversary of her death, describing her as "the best mother in the <unk-28> in a speech at a memorial service. Here is his speech in <unk-41> . William and I can separate life into two parts. There were those years when we were blessed with the physical presence beside us of both our mother and father. Princes Harry and William greet guests at a <unk-80> service in memory of their mother. And then there are the 10 years since our mother's death. When she was alive, we completely took for granted her <unk-108> love of life, <unk-112> fun and <unk-115> She was our <unk-119> friend and <unk-122> She never once allowed her <unk-128> love for us to go <unk-134> or <unk-136> She will always be remembered for her amazing public work. But behind the media <unk-151> to us, just two loving children, she was quite simply the best mother in the world. We would say that, wouldn't <unk-173> But we miss her. She kissed us last thing at night. Her beaming smile greeted us from school. She laughed <unk-194> and <unk-196> when sharing something silly she might have said or done that day. She encouraged us when we were nervous or <unk-217> She -- like our father -- was determined to provide us with a stable and secure <unk-234> To lose a parent so suddenly at such a young age, as others have <unk-249> is <unk-251> shocking and sad. It was an event which changed our lives <unk-263> as it must have done for everyone who lost someone that night. But what is far more important to us now, and into the future, is that we remember our mother as she would have wished to be remembered as she <unk-305> <unk-306> <unk-307> <unk-308> entirely <unk-310> We both think of her every day. We speak about her and laugh together at all the <unk-328> Put <unk-330> she made us, and so many other people, happy. May this be the way that she is <unk-348> Prince William's reading from St Paul's letter to the <unk-358> . I bow my knees before the <unk-366> from whom every family in heaven and on earth takes its name. I pray that, according to the <unk-385> of His <unk-388> He may grant that you may be strengthened in your inner being with power through His <unk-405> and that Christ may <unk-410> in your hearts through faith, as you are being rooted and grounded in love. I pray that you may have the power to <unk-434> with all the <unk-438> what is the <unk-442> and length and height and <unk-448> and to know the love of Christ that <unk-457> knowledge, so that you may be filled with all the <unk-468> of God.

Mitt Romney has spent the most on TV advertising so far among presidential <unk-55> The cost to try to influence the 2008 election could exceed $3 billion, according to <unk-71> Media <unk-73> Media Analysis Group, CNN's consultant on political television <unk-82> This is nearly twice as much than what was spent in 2004 when political and <unk-29> television advertising rang in at <unk-104> billion. In 2006, <unk-108> billion was spent on political and <unk-29> TV <unk-117> Just about every candidate running for an office from <unk-127> to president is spending the money, said Evan <unk-136> <unk-137> chief operating officer. The costs to produce a TV commercial are no longer <unk-151> for local and state candidates, who are turning more and more to the <unk-165> to reach voters. See how spending breaks down for this year » . And interest groups have spent <unk-184> million on TV ads so far this year for state and local ballot measures. On the national level, the cost of <unk-29> television ad spending was <unk-211> million in the first nine months of this year. <unk-221> ranged from the Iraq war to <unk-228> reform. Television ads on health care alone total $60 million. <unk-239> estimates more than $3 million of the <unk-211> million spent to air <unk-29> ads this year has gone for <unk-259> in states and districts that are likely to have competitive House and Senate races in 2008. Tracey said he thinks this is just the beginning of interest groups <unk-288> from legislative advocacy mode to political <unk-295> "What we expect to see between now and the end of the <unk-308> and through the general election, is groups will take a more aggressive stance on their advertising and actually target <unk-328> he said. With 17 Democratic and Republican candidates running for president, <unk-239> predicts that more than <unk-345> million will be spent on TV ads in the battle for the White House. Up to now, the political <unk-259> have been largely focused on the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Voters in some of the <unk-386> states holding <unk-389> <unk-390> on February 5 will start seeing ads in the coming months. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney leads all candidates in TV spending, having aired his <unk-259> more than 11,000 times this year at a cost of nearly <unk-428> million. This is a record for the number of <unk-438> at this point in a presidential election <unk-446> Watch how Romney is way ahead in ad spending » . In contrast, one of Romney's chief rivals for the GOP <unk-468> former New York Mayor Rudy <unk-474> has spent nothing on television <unk-480> but <unk-482> leads in the national polls and is within striking distance of the lead in several state <unk-499> <unk-482> enjoys widespread national name <unk-505> while Romney does not. In the race for the Democratic <unk-468> Illinois Sen. Barack Obama has spent more than <unk-108> million on television <unk-529> while New York Sen. Hillary Clinton has spent $1 million less and leads in both national and early state <unk-549> New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson has probably benefited the most in the Democratic contest from the $2 million he has invested in his television <unk-117> <unk-575> <unk-576> TV ads effectively stated his experience as a <unk-585> diplomat and executive, and positioned him as a solid <unk-595> candidate. Romney used his <unk-428> million in television ads to introduce himself as a social and fiscal conservative to Republican voters. These voters might otherwise not know much about him other than that he was the governor of the traditionally liberal Massachusetts. Romney is leading polls in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire. Further evidence of how Romney's television <unk-259> have helped is in South Carolina. An American Research Group poll of South Carolina Republicans in August showed Romney <unk-678> at 9 percent with these influential primary voters. A month later, and with <unk-692> worth of <unk-259> aired in the two weeks leading up to the next poll, Romney was up 17 percentage points. Romney's latest ad began airing Friday in Iowa, and in it he vows to stop Iran from <unk-730> nuclear weapons, to boost the military by 100,000 people, to strengthen U.S. intelligence capabilities and to monitor calls into the U.S. from al Qaeda. All of these issues should play well with conservatives who participate in the Iowa <unk-769> While only a handful of Democratic candidates and Romney have used the <unk-165> until now, Tracey said he expects this to change. <unk-792> the end of October, I suspect all the <unk-801> candidates will be on the <unk-807> Tracey said. "As we get closer to primary day, the <unk-818> will be joined by all the candidates in the race who are taking their last, best <unk-835> In the fight for Congress, <unk-239> predicts that as much as <unk-847> million could be spent on television <unk-82> Democrats control the House and Senate. Tracey noted that <unk-137> 2008 election cycle forecast does not take into account <unk-874> events such as former Florida Rep. Mark <unk-882> House page scandal or the September 11 terrorist attacks. <unk-892> is completely <unk-895> to <unk-897> he said. <unk-900> will ultimately determine how much is <unk-907> where and <unk-910> What television advertising challenges do candidates and interest groups face in the coming <unk-924> <unk-925> are, just as what happened in 2006, voters will be <unk-936> after watching hundred and hundreds of <unk-943> said Stuart <unk-946> editor of the <unk-950> <unk-951> Political <unk-953> "The sheer number of ads probably <unk-960> their <unk-962> After a while, the ads just become lots of <unk-972> and an ad will have to be really good to cut through the <unk-986> E-mail to a friend .

Many <unk-145> and scientists say <unk-149> ice melt and other changes in the Earth's climate are the result of an increase in the world's <unk-168> a trend widely called global <unk-174> Many global warming experts say the <unk-181> if <unk-183> is capable of <unk-187> the world's climate and <unk-192> In the <unk-195> <unk-196> experts say oceans could rise to overwhelming and catastrophic levels, flooding cities and <unk-187> <unk-211> Other scientists and <unk-215> a minority compared to those who believe the warming trend is something <unk-228> say it is simply the latest shift in the <unk-238> patterns of a planet's life. Most of the scientific community believes that some warming is occurring across the globe and through some layers of the atmosphere. But why it is occurring and what that means for the future is <unk-278> and politically <unk-281> The Earth's temperature <unk-285> about 60 degrees <unk-289> (about 16 degrees <unk-293> The average surface temperature has <unk-299> one degree <unk-289> <unk-303> degrees <unk-305> during the last century, according to the National Research Council. The temperatures were relatively <unk-320> from <unk-322> to <unk-324> according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. They rose till about <unk-336> <unk-337> until about 1975 and have risen steadily to present day. There are several possible reasons for the <unk-355> scientists say. A change in the Earth's orbit or the intensity of the <unk-369> radiation could change, triggering warming or <unk-376> The reason most cited -- by scientists and scientific organizations -- for the current warming trend is an increase in the <unk-398> of greenhouse <unk-401> which are in the atmosphere naturally and help keep the planet's temperature at a comfortable level. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, for instance, has increased by 35 percent since the dawn of the industrial age, according to the United <unk-444> <unk-445> <unk-446> on Climate <unk-449> commonly referred to as the <unk-455> The presence of methane is now <unk-462> percent above <unk-465> levels, but the rate of increase has slowed in recent decades, according to the <unk-480> Meanwhile, <unk-482> <unk-483> increased by about 18 percent during the past 200 years. Many scientists and experts who have studied global warming believe the increase is primarily the result of human activities, like the burning of fossil <unk-518> emissions from vehicles and the clearing of <unk-526> "For the last 30 years, there's no way there's anything natural that can explain it," Stephen <unk-543> a professor of environmental studies at Stanford University in California, said. "A vast bulk of the <unk-560> and honest community ... will say the science is settled and humans are at least a majority of the reason behind the <unk-583> he added. Many scientific organizations share <unk-590> view, ranging from the national <unk-596> of the countries that <unk-601> the G8 to the National Research Council, the American <unk-611> Society and the American <unk-616> Union.

<unk-0> Chad (CNN) -- Most of the <unk-7> children that a French charity attempted to take to France from Chad for adoption are neither Sudanese nor <unk-26> three international aid agencies reported on Thursday. Hundreds of women protest child trafficking and shout <unk-42> slogans Wednesday in <unk-46> <unk-47> Six members of <unk-51> <unk-52> were arrested last week as they tried to put the children on a plane to France, where the charity said host families were waiting to take the children in. Three French journalists, a <unk-86> Spanish flight crew and one Belgian were also arrested. Representatives of the journalists and flight crew said they were unaware of problems with <unk-51> <unk-52> and thought they were on a humanitarian mission. <unk-120> President <unk-122> <unk-123> hopes the journalists and the flight crew will be <unk-133> his chief of staff, <unk-138> <unk-139> said Thursday. The president would legally be able to intervene in the case if it is transferred from a judge in the eastern city of <unk-46> where the children were taken, to a judge in <unk-175> the capital, <unk-178> said. The transfer will take place Monday, according to media reports. The International Red Cross Committee, the U.N. High Commissioner for <unk-200> and <unk-202> said most of the children were living with their families before <unk-51> <unk-52> took them. The charity said the children were Sudanese <unk-225> that it was trying to rescue from a war-torn nation.

But the four women and three men are in good condition in custody, <unk-446> said, based on his conversations with a Spanish consular official who came from Cameroon to Chad and has been able to visit them. The detention is the first problem of its kind for the company, which hopes government negotiations can resolve the issue, <unk-446> said. On its Web site, <unk-51> <unk-52> describes itself as a nonprofit organization based in Paris that sends teams of <unk-526> <unk-527> firefighters and other specialists to care for children in war zones and place them with families in France, who then apply for asylum on their behalf. The Red Cross, <unk-557> and <unk-202> said the 21 girls and 82 boys range in age from about 1 year to about 10, and they are healthy. The agencies said they have been interviewing the children individually to determine their <unk-594> "So far, the interviews carried out with the children -- some of whom could not provide any information due to their young age -- led to the preliminary conclusion that probably 85 come from <unk-120> villages near the cities of <unk-635> and <unk-637> along the <unk-640> <unk-641> the agencies said. <unk-645> children said they had been living with their family, consisting of at least one adult they considered to be their <unk-666> the agencies said, adding that interviews with the remaining 12 children were ongoing.

The reason behind the jump in the number of Iraqis at the school is a new government <unk-178> For the first time since the start of the Iraq war, Jordan is allowing all Iraqi children -- regardless of refugee status -- to <unk-203> in <unk-138> schools. <unk-207> this means that even illegal refugees with no paperwork can send their kids to school with no questions asked. The move is <unk-230> a massive population shift in the Middle East. More than <unk-241> million Iraqis have fled the violence in their <unk-250> most of them seeking refuge in neighboring Jordan and Syria, according to humanitarian officials. Jordanian Minister of Education Khalid <unk-270> says he expects Jordan to accommodate 40,000 to 50,000 Iraqi students this year. That's more than double the number of Iraqi children enrolled in public school two years ago. <unk-300> on the front line of the <unk-307> says the influx is putting a strain on her school.

The United Nations High Commissioner for <unk-565> estimates up to 250,000 <unk-570> Iraqi children are in <unk-575> Many of them are enrolled in private <unk-583> But as families run out of money they had when they left Iraq, they turn to public schools. Even so, more than a month into the new academic year, fewer Iraqi families than first anticipated enrolled their kids in schools this year. According to the charity Save the <unk-632> <unk-633> Iraqi children have so far enrolled in Jordanian <unk-642> As a result, the government extended the deadline for student applications and cut down on the required paperwork for Iraqi families. The lower registration numbers were attributed in part to illegal <unk-674> fears of being identified through their children's school records. <unk-684> of what the final number will be this year, the population shift in the Middle East is, according to <unk-704> head Antonio <unk-707> the largest urban refugee situation in the world. Iraqi families are changing the social fabric of Jordanian society. About 10 percent of Jordan's population is now made up of Iraqi refugees -- the estimates range from 500,000 to <unk-746> of them. The schoolchildren are living examples of how the Iraq war may permanently change the Middle East. <unk-765> children will be incorporated and integrated within our mainstream line of <unk-777> says <unk-779> the education minister.

The reason behind the jump in the number of Iraqis at the school is a new government <unk-178> For the first time since the start of the Iraq war, Jordan is allowing all Iraqi children -- regardless of refugee status -- to <unk-203> in <unk-138> schools. <unk-207> this means that even illegal refugees with no paperwork can send their kids to school with no questions asked. The move is <unk-230> a massive population shift in the Middle East. More than <unk-241> million Iraqis have fled the violence in their <unk-250> most of them seeking refuge in neighboring Jordan and Syria, according to humanitarian officials. Jordanian Minister of Education Khalid <unk-270> says he expects Jordan to accommodate 40,000 to 50,000 Iraqi students this year. That's more than double the number of Iraqi children enrolled in public school two years ago. <unk-300> on the front line of the <unk-307> says the influx is putting a strain on her school. Even with some U.N. and U.S. aid to Jordan, there's still not enough money. "We need more teachers here, more resources, more buildings, more chairs for all Iraqi students and our <unk-349> she says. In a nearby neighborhood, in the study room of the Ahmed <unk-363> School for <unk-366> a handful of Iraqi kids talk of their experience living far from home. <unk-380> at a <unk-383> table covered with a red and white <unk-391> the boys tell stories of horror and <unk-399> <unk-400> <unk-401> lost five immediate family members before moving to Jordan to try to live a normal life. <unk-418> and with a <unk-422> <unk-423> he <unk-60> the <unk-427> <unk-428> <unk-429> Most of the boys and young men from Iraq have missed several years of school -- up to a four-year educational gap that will delay not only their high school <unk-460> but also their entry into the <unk-467> All say, though, that they feel lucky to have gotten out, even if the violence in their country means always having to be on the move, ready to live far from home and away from loved ones.

In America, I left them. I came here, I left them." He <unk-551> "But you have to miss your country." The United Nations High Commissioner for <unk-565> estimates up to 250,000 <unk-570> Iraqi children are in <unk-575> Many of them are enrolled in private <unk-583> But as families run out of money they had when they left Iraq, they turn to public schools. Even so, more than a month into the new academic year, fewer Iraqi families than first anticipated enrolled their kids in schools this year. According to the charity Save the <unk-632> <unk-633> Iraqi children have so far enrolled in Jordanian <unk-642> As a result, the government extended the deadline for student applications and cut down on the required paperwork for Iraqi families. The lower registration numbers were attributed in part to illegal <unk-674> fears of being identified through their children's school records. <unk-684> of what the final number will be this year, the population shift in the Middle East is, according to <unk-704> head Antonio <unk-707> the largest urban refugee situation in the world. Iraqi families are changing the social fabric of Jordanian society. About 10 percent of Jordan's population is now made up of Iraqi refugees -- the estimates range from 500,000 to <unk-746> of them. The schoolchildren are living examples of how the Iraq war may permanently change the Middle East. <unk-765> children will be incorporated and integrated within our mainstream line of <unk-777> says <unk-779> the education minister.

In a match played in torrential rain, Italy enjoyed the best possible start by taking the lead after just 70 seconds. <unk-129> <unk-130> spotted Antonio Di <unk-134> unmarked in the box, and picked him out with a <unk-145> as Scotland were caught <unk-150> Di <unk-134> swept the ball into the path of Toni who <unk-162> <unk-163> into the top left corner from six meters out. The home side almost conceded a second goal 60 seconds later. This time, Toni turned provider and his <unk-191> was met by <unk-195> <unk-196> who fired over from <unk-201> Toni then <unk-204> off two challenges before drawing a decent save from Craig Gordon with a <unk-218> effort that the goalkeeper did well to block at the near post. At the other end, Scotland were denied the opportunity to haul themselves back into the match when a <unk-249> drive from Lee <unk-253> appeared to be handled by <unk-130> inside the area but penalty claims were <unk-267> <unk-268> on by a sense of <unk-274> the hosts <unk-277> up the pressure on their visitors.

He was denied by <unk-540> but the <unk-364> fell <unk-545> to Ferguson and the captain <unk-551> <unk-362> home from <unk-201> With just over 15 minutes to go, Scott Brown was withdrawn for Kenny Miller as Scotland went for <unk-574> The Derby striker quickly began to cause the Italians problems and delivered a wonderful <unk-589> cross to the feet of <unk-290> but he fired wide when it looked easier score.

<unk-0> <unk-1> California (CNN) -- You must know what's really driving the immigration debate. It's the culture, <unk-17> Ruben <unk-19> <unk-20> Some opponents of immigration, even the legal kind, fear changes in local culture. Immigration <unk-35> -- and by that, I mean those who want to limit all immigration, even the legal kind -- like to pretend they're so <unk-59> Yet they can't help themselves. They always take the low road and <unk-72> back to the <unk-76> that greeted earlier waves of immigrants. The <unk-35> insist that what <unk-88> them are merely practical <unk-93> that our borders aren't <unk-98> that so many immigrants are coming into the country <unk-108> and that the new arrivals are <unk-115> schools and <unk-118> social services once they get here. <unk-125> If that's the extent of it, then why does the conversation quickly turn to the impact -- both real and perceived -- that immigrants have on American culture through everything from <unk-157> trucks to <unk-160> <unk-161> That seems to be the issue in North Dakota, where, according to a recent article in USA Today, towns facing tough economic times are <unk-186> resisting a cultural <unk-190> that could save them. In <unk-196> the locals opposed efforts to bring in a <unk-205> plant and a <unk-209> because those kind of dirty and hard jobs are likely to attract ... guess <unk-224> American kids who work at <unk-230> <unk-231> The article quotes <unk-235> <unk-236> a local community leader in <unk-196> who says that some residents have told him <unk-251> to <unk-253> that such facilities might attract Hispanic immigrants who could change the local culture.

A leader of the <unk-390> <unk-391> movement <unk-393> called it the <unk-397> of the United States.

According to Evans, there had been "no <unk-260> in the number of Russian covert intelligence officers operating in Britain since the end of the Cold War.

Unlike previous debates in which the candidates focused most of their attacks on Democratic <unk-101> Hillary Clinton, Wednesday night's attacks were launched at each other. Former New York Mayor Rudy <unk-117> and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney traded <unk-125> over illegal immigration, something they have been arguing about on the trail for the past month.

Keith Reynolds was convicted for witness intimidation after threatening witnesses in his domestic assault case. The man, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the case, says the state did nothing to protect him after the 1999 conviction of Keith Reynolds for domestic abuse -- even after prosecutors told him a hit had been put on his family. A report in the Denver Post pointed out major problems protecting witnesses in the state of Colorado. Paul <unk-124> chairman of National District <unk-129> Association, told Congress this year that witness intimidation has become <unk-140> <unk-141> according to the Denver Post.

No national statistics on crimes against witnesses <unk-308> and minimal research has been conducted on the <unk-317> The latest National Institute of Justice survey on record -- conducted more than a decade ago -- shows that more than half of big city prosecutors consider witness intimidation a major problem. Colorado has $50,000 allocated to its witness protection budget. In contrast, the city of Denver spent almost $100,000 on <unk-369> last year.

A U.S. military panel reviews a <unk-43> case at Camp <unk-47> near Baghdad. Speaking in <unk-52> Maj. Gen.

Stone said detainees get free medical care equal to what he gets as a general, food and water made to Islamic standards, educational <unk-135> jobs skills and contact with families. The U.S. detention centers -- at Camp <unk-149> near the southern port city of <unk-156> and in Camp <unk-47> near Baghdad -- are political sore points for <unk-169> who make up 83 percent of the detainees held. The main Sunni political coalition -- the Iraqi <unk-187> Front -- cited the centers as one reason for quitting the government during the summer. Last month, the U.S.-led coalition launched Operation <unk-210> <unk-211> in which between 50 and 70 detainees would be released daily during the Islamic holy month of <unk-229> after taking a pledge not to <unk-236> the insurgency against the <unk-241> government.

LONDON, England (CNN) -- Previously <unk-5> footage of Diana, Princess of Wales, taken just hours before she was killed in a car crash, has been shown to the jury at the inquest into her death. The footage showed Diana and <unk-40> step into an elevator at the <unk-47> <unk-48> Images taken from a security camera at the <unk-47> Hotel in Paris show the 36-year-old smiling as she and her lover <unk-40> <unk-71> step into an elevator and later walk out of the hotel. Further footage shows <unk-71> visiting a <unk-89> shop, images that could lend support to claims that he was buying an engagement ring. Earlier, a British coroner at the inquest said <unk-113> may never be known for certain whether Princess Diana was pregnant when she died in the Paris car crash. Lord Justice Scott Baker told the jury at the inquest into the deaths of the princess and her lover <unk-40> <unk-71> that scientific evidence might be unable to demonstrate "one way or the <unk-166> whether she was in the early stages of pregnancy. But he said they would hear <unk-182> details of her personal life. Watch footage of <unk-191> last hours » .

The jury is set to hear <unk-293> <unk-294> evidence, including CCTV and a tourist video. The inquest to establish cause of death is expected to be a six-month process. <unk-316> father, Mohammed Al <unk-320> has <unk-322> from the start that Diana and his son were murdered because the royal family <unk-337> not accept that an Egyptian Muslim could eventually be <unk-347> to the future king of <unk-353> referring to <unk-191> son Prince <unk-359> "I'm hoping for <unk-363> Al <unk-71> said outside court. "At last, we're going to have a jury from ordinary people and I hope to reach the decision which I believe that my son and Princess Diana have been murdered by the royal family." Baker told the jury of Al <unk-316> allegations, but again reminded them that they were responsible for deciding the facts of the case, but not to <unk-429> blame or <unk-432> "You have to decide four important, but limited <unk-441> <unk-442> who the deceased were, when they came by their deaths, where they came by their deaths and how they came by their <unk-465> Baker said, according to inquest <unk-471> "The first three questions are unlikely to give rise to any <unk-483> The fourth is a rather wider question and is directed towards the means by which they <unk-500> Diana, 36, and 42-year-old <unk-40> <unk-71> were killed on August 31, 1997 when the <unk-515> they were traveling in hit a <unk-522> in the <unk-525> de <unk-527> tunnel in Paris.
